probe to land in the south pole region of the far side of the moon in 2018, according to CNSA (China National Space Administration). This lunar exploration mission will incorporate an orbiter, a robotic lander and rover. Chang&#x27;e-4 will be China&#x27;s second lunar lander and rover. The Chang&#x27;e-4 lander was a backup to the Chang&#x27;e-3 mission, so it will have the same basic structure, but a different scientific payload, holding 11 instruments. <sup><a href="#foot1%29" id="footback1)">1)</a></sup> <sup><a href="#foot2%29" id="footback2)">2)</a></sup></p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">With its special environment and complex geological history, the far side of the moon is a hot spot for scientific and space exploration. However, landing and roving there requires the relay satellite to transmit signals.

In the highland area, craters and mountains are widely spread. The well-known South-Pole Aitken Basin (SPA) is located in the southern part of the farside, with the central area at latitude 40°–60°S, longitude around 180° and the diameter ranging from 2000–600 km. This is the largest-scaled and eldest impacted basin in the solar system and of high scientific interest. <sup><a href="#foot6%29" id="footback6)">6)</a></sup></p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">The farside of the Moon, for its special location, is of unique peculiarity that the nearside cannot match. On one hand, the farside shields all kinds of radio waves emitted from the Earth, thus becomes the best place for cosmic radio spectrum detection. On the other hand, the original information of the Moon is hidden in the largest, deepest and eldest SPA. It is crucial for the study of the history, evolution, composition and components of the deep-layer of both the Moon and the Earth system. Besides, how SPA is formed remains controversial and deserves further research. Soft landing on the SPA as well as rovering exploration of it are of great scientific significance mainly in the following two aspects.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">Planetary formation and evolution:</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">1) The study of SPA may benefit the discovery of material composition of Lunar crust and mantle. So it opens an important window to the study of the deep-layer material composition of the Moon.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">2) SPA is a basin (its altitude is 13 km lower than its surrounding highlands) and of thin crust. Whether in the passive or active modes that bring out the Lunar mare basalt, there should have emerged large amount of basalt in SPA. However, currently obtained data cannot effectively prove that the basin has abundant basalt. On the other hand, absence of basalt may indicate something happened in the process of Lunar thermal evolution and differentiation in early times.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">3) Comparing the craters in SPA with the Lunar mare we can see that the degradation situation of SPA is not obvious. Also no crater with Lunar rays has been discovered. Therefore the formation, evolution, topography and chemical characteristics of craters in the SPA are apparently different from those of other terrains.</p><style data-emotion="css 1gm22d1">.css-1gm22d1{display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-flex-direction:column;-ms-flex-direction:column;flex-direction:column;-webkit-margin-start:auto;margin-inline-start:auto;-webkit-margin-end:auto;margin-inline-end:auto;max-width:-webkit-fit-content;max-width:-moz-fit-content;max-width:fit-content;margin-top:var(--chakra-space-6);margin-bottom:var(--chakra-space-6);gap:var(--chakra-space-3);}</style><figure class="css-1gm22d1"><span tabindex="-1"><style data-emotion="css 1fri2vb">.css-1fri2vb{display:grid;place-items:center;}</style><div class="css-1fri2vb"><img src="https://eoportal.org/ftp/satellite-missions/c/Chang-e4_050122/Chang-e4_Auto40.jpeg" alt="Figure 1: Elevation diagram of the South-Pole Aitken Basin (scale in km).

At present, most portion of the spectrum has been detected, such as ultraviolet wave (in 1890s), radio wave (wavelength less than meters, in 1930s), X-ray (in 1940s), infrared and millimeter wave (in 1950s), Gamma-ray (in 1960s). But no myriametric wave (&lt;30 MHz) has been detected yet. The detection of myriametric wave is of much importance for all-sky imaging obtained by continuous sky scanning of discrete radio source, cosmic dark times study (21 cm radiation in dark times), solar physics, space weather, extreme-high-energy cosmic ray and neutrino study. <sup><a href="#foot7%29" id="footback7)">7)</a></sup></p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">Interfered by ionosphere and Earth radio waves, it is impossible to detect myriametric wave on the Earth. In earlier times, wave detection satellites are RAE-A/B (NASA). RAE-A was launched in 1968 and operated in near-Earth orbit. Its scientific objective was to detect the intensity of cosmic ray (0.2–20 MHz). But it was interfered by radio waves in Earth orbit. RAE-B was launched in 1973 and was injected into the lunar orbit, whose scientific objective was to detect the long-wavelength radio waves (working frequency 25 kHz–13.1 MHz). It demonstrated that the lunar farside is ideal for myriametric wave detection. <sup><a href="#foot8%29" id="footback8)">8)</a></sup></p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">At present, low-frequency radio detection was mainly achieved via spacecraft operating in circumlunar orbit by foreign countries but none of them has done this on the Lunar surface.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">The exploration of Change’4 will further promote people’s understanding of the farside of the Moon. With comprehensive analysis and study on the nearside exploration data, more general understanding about the Moon will be obtained and the reliability of a theoretical system will be increased.</p><h3 class="chakra-heading css-jnz50r" id="engineering-difficulties"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#engineering-difficulties"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Engineering Difficulties</h3><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">To land on the farside and carry on in-situ exploration has become one of the great targets for lunar exploration of all nations. Nevertheless, no country had success in landing on that side. One of the major reasons is that landing on the farside of the moon needs to meet more technical challenges. Compared with the nearside, the technical difficulties of landing on the farside involve the following three aspects.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">Safe landing under complex landform situation (Ref. <a href="#yAK$R11d0Herb">2)</a>:</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">To ensure the landing safety, guidance, navigation and control method should be optimized to adapt to the complex terrain. On the other hand, with careful orbit design and control, the distribution of landing sites is reduced for landing safety.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">1) Influence of the topographic relief. In the descent process, the length of path of the lander is almost 450 km on the Lunar surface. During this process, the distance and velocity should be measured for navigation of the descent. At the farside of the Moon, the topographic relief is more apparent than that at the nearside, with the topographic elevation difference increased from 3 km to 7 km. The difference brings out the jump of navigation information and extreme difficulties for control strategy. Therefore, the sectional control target and navigation information utilization time as well as navigation algorithm should be optimized to decrease the influence of the great topographic relief.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">2) Decrease of the backscattering coefficient. Research results show that the site on which Change’3 has landed at the nearside of the Moon is opposite to the SPA(South-Pole Aiken) basin at the farside of the Moon, and the contents of FeO and TiO<sub>2</sub> are 15%–25% and 0%–15%, while the average value of them on the nearside of the Moon are 15%–20% more than that on the farside. The low contents of FeO and TiO<sub>2</sub> decrease backscattering coefficient of microwaves and directly influence the echo characteristics of range and velocity microwave sensor (RVS). Therefore, the signal emission energy and signal-noise-ratio should be increased to obtain useful measuring data.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">3) Reducing the distribution of landing sites. Due to the complex terrain of the farside, it is difficult to find out a large flat area. For different launch windows, the landing sites may be widely distributed without precise orbit control and descent process control. Different from Change’3, the circumlunar orbits with various inclination angles for different launch windows are designed for Change’4 specific requirements. Meanwhile, the orbit is carefully regulated in the circumlunar phase. With in-orbit calibration of the 7500 N thrust-variance engine, the powered descent process path is precisely controlled and the landing sites are reduced to a flat and small area.</p><h3 class="chakra-heading css-jnz50r" id="rtg-radioisotope-thermoelectric-generator-and-thermoelectric-technology"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#rtg-radioisotope-thermoelectric-generator-and-thermoelectric-technology"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>RTG (Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator) and Thermoelectric Technology</h3><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">For data collection of the temperature of the Lunar soil in moon night, the temperature sensor has to have a power supply. Currently, the most realistic method is to utilize the RTG, which is based on the Seebeck principle to transform the heat energy into the electric energy. When generating electric power, the RTG can also supply great heat energy to regulate temperature. Generally Pu-238 is used as the RTG source (Ref. <a href="#yAK$R11d0Herb">2)</a>.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">Compared with the RTG used in Change’3, the thermoelectric module should be increased in the RTG of Change’4, which may mean various technical difficulties, including high-performance thermoelectric material manufacture, high-performance thermoelectric components design and assembly, high-efficiency heat transformation, etc.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">1) High-performance thermoelectric material manufacture technology. Thermoelectric material is the core material in the RTG. The electric and mechanical performance and the thermal stability directly determine the reliability and stability of the RTG. Currently, PbTe and CoSb<sub>3</sub> are used, while PbTe is well developed but with lesser performance. For further design, the chemical dose ratio adjustment, the doping impurity selection and manufacture process should be optimized to make the material meet the engineering requirement.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">2) High-performance thermoelectric components design and assembly technology. The thermoelectric components are comprised of π type pairs of the P-type and N-type materials and directly determine key parameters such as the output voltage, the inner resistor and the output power of the RTG. The design and assembly of the energy transfer components determine the reliability, including the components joint process design, the matching design for the thermal expansion coefficient of the electrode material and substrate material and the shelter layer and transition layer optimization. For future improvements, the different temperatures in both nighttime and daytime on the Moon should be considered. Calculation, simulation, test and verification should be done to satisfy engineering requirements.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">3) High-efficiency thermoelectric transformation technology. The thermoelectric transformation efficiency and decay rate of the RTG directly determines the lifetime and the performance of the RTG and is a vital segment for the success of the mission in moon night. The key technology is thermal flow design of the RTG, which aims to maximize the heat transformation from thermoelectric components to heat collector. Meanwhile, the RTG shell should have the layer of high emission ratio and low-absorption ratio to ensure the safe of RTG under the high temperature at Lunar daytime.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs"> </p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">For decades, this basin has been a source of fascination for scientists; and in recent years, multiple missions have confirmed the existence of water ice in the region. Determining the extent of the water ice is one of the main focuses of the rover mission component. However, the lander will also to be equipped with an aluminum case filled with insects and plants that will test the effects of lunar gravity on terrestrial organisms.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">These studies will play a key role in China’s long-term plans to mount crewed missions to the Moon, and the possible construction of a lunar outpost.

This enables researchers to calculate the &#x27;equivalent dose&#x27;, which is important for estimating biological effects.</p><h3 class="chakra-heading css-jnz50r" id="high-radiation-exposure-in-a-spacesuit"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#high-radiation-exposure-in-a-spacesuit"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>High Radiation Exposure in a Spacesuit</h3><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">- DLR radiation physicist Thomas Berger from the <a target="_self" class="chakra-link css-u5m5d0" href="https://www.dlr.de/content/en/institutes/institute-of-aerospace-medicine.html"><span class="chakra-text css-nc7yv5">DLR Institute of Aerospace Medicine</span></a>, who participated in the publication explains: &quot;The radiation exposure we measured is a good indication of the radiation inside a spacesuit. The measurements give us an equivalent dose rate – the biologically weighted radiation dose per unit of time – of around 60 microsieverts per hour. For comparison, during a long-haul flight from Frankfurt to New York, the dose rate is five to 10 times lower than this. On Earth&#x27;s surface, it is some 200 times lower. In other words, a long-term stay on the Moon will expose astronauts&#x27; bodies to high doses of radiation.&quot;</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">- &quot;Human bodies are simply not made to be exposed to space radiation,&quot; adds Robert Wimmer-Schweingruber of the Christian-Albrecht University (CAU) in Kiel, whose team developed and built the <a target="_self" class="chakra-link css-u5m5d0" href="https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s11214-020-00725-3?sharing_token=yM0G6YRGkeahID9_CL-LV_e4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY4KW2Ew4jw801Oflt5mNq37bh9zawC-7RQo2hqPn4gELrSWmoHiMETDQYVkdzno21dJkw4BY4ZYsMtodj7Wd3bvfoTEGYVJ1wYUOP6VLT6jZcCph1NK9Dq3i8hrt8Lrcsg%3D"><span class="chakra-text css-nc7yv5">LND instrument</span></a>. &quot;On longer missions to the Moon, astronauts will have to protect themselves from it – by covering their habitat with a thick layer of lunar rock, for example.

For the second objective, LND is capable to measure particle fluxes and their temporal variations and thus will contribute to the understanding of particle propagation and transport in the heliosphere.

Three detectors (B, C, and D) are packed as close together as possible to measure neutrons in the energy range 1-20 MeV (see section 3). The lower six detectors (E-J) are mounted in two different sandwich configurations. In one each sandwich clamps a very thin (~20 µm) Gd foil (shown in red) to detect thermal neutrons. To discriminate thermal neutrons which are emitted from the lunar soil (and are thus sensitive to the subsurface proton (water) content), the GH sandwich is shielded from above by a thicker Gd foil which is encased in two thick Al sheets. The GH sandwich then measures thermal neutrons from below and the EF sandwich thermal neutrons from above. The lowermost sandwich is a copy of the IRAS BCsandwich and serves as the final detector in the stack.

Under the constraints of the launching mass and size, the relay communication link should be optimized in multiple aspects such as the relay transmission modes and the high gain relay antenna development to achieve high-bit-rate communication.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs" id="Chang-e4.html.69">Relay communications: The link between Change’4 relay satellite and lander/rover is designed to work on X-band. The forward link uses unified carrier-wave TT&amp;C regime and the backward uses BPSK. The forward relay signal emitter should be able to scan with complex frequency carrier waves, similar to ground stations. The relay satellite should be able to transmit data to Earth and relay with the lander and the rover simultaneously. To avoid interference, the relay link adopts X-band channel, and TT&amp;C to Earth chooses S-band unified carrier wave regime and the data transmission utilizes S-band and BPSK carrier wave regime. Channel encoding is not used for telecommand transmission and RS+concatenated convolution channel encoding is adopted for telemetry and data transmission. Meanwhile for the purpose of synchronous encoding with the ground, both telemetry and data pseudo-random coded.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">Relay communication link design: The link profile among the relay satellite, the lander and the rover and ground stations is as shown in Figure <a href="#a$iXR1267Herb">46</a>. The forward data is emitted from the relay satellite, the lander and the rover receive data via omnidirectional antenna and the signals are modulated in PCM/PSK/PM. The backward data is transmitted via an omnidirectional antenna, a medium gain antenna or a directional antenna and is received by the relay satellite. The backward link data of the rover is transmitted by the omnidirectional antenna or the directional antenna and is received by the relay satellite. The lander backward link adopts omnidirectional antenna, medium gain antenna and directional antenna corresponding to low, medium and high bit rates.

This proved useful in the early lunar landing missions in the 20th century, as there was always a direct line of sight for uninterrupted radiocommunications between Earth ground stations and equipment on the Moon. However, gravitational locking makes exploring the hidden face of the moon - the far side - much more challenging, because signals cannot be sent directly across the Moon towards Earth. <sup><a href="#foot85%29" id="footback85)">85)</a></sup></p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs" id="Chang-e4.html.73">- Still, in January 2019, China&#x27;s lunar probe Chang&#x27;e-4 marked the first time a spacecraft landed on the far side of the Moon. Both the lander and the lunar rover it carried have been gathering and sending back images and data from previously unexplored areas. But how does Chang&#x27;e-4 probe communicate with the Earth? The answer is Queqiao, a relay communications satellite, explains Dr. Lihua Zhang from DFH Satellite Co., Ltd., China.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">- As explained by Dr. Zhang in a review paper recently published in Space: Science and Technology, Queqiao is an unprecedented satellite designed specifically for one purpose: to act as a bridge between Chang&#x27;e-4 probe and the Earth. Queqiao was launched in 2018 and put into orbit around a point &#x27;behind&#x27; the Moon. <sup><a href="#foot86%29" id="footback86)">86)</a></sup></p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">- This point is known as the Earth-Moon Libration point 2, where a special case of gravitational balance allows Queqiao to maintain an orbit such that it has almost constant direct line of sight with both the far side of the Moon and the Earth. Getting the satellite into this peculiar orbit required careful planning and maintenance management, and the success of this operation set a precedent for future attempts at putting satellites in orbit around other Earth-Moon libration points.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">- From its stable place in space, Queqiao helped guide the soft-landing and surface operations of Chang&#x27;e-4 probe and has been our intermediary with it ever since. The satellite is equipped with two different kinds of antennas: a parabolic antenna and several spiral antennas. The former, which has a large diameter of 4.2 m, was designed to send and receive signals on the X-band (7-8 GHz) to and from the rover and lander on the surface of the Moon. Its large size is related the expected noise levels and the low intensity of the transmissions that are sent by surface equipment.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">- On the other hand, the spiral antennas operate on the S-band (2-4 GHz) and communicate with Earth ground stations, forwarding commands to the lunar surface equipment and exchanging telemetry and tracking data. Most notably, all these different links can transmit and receive simultaneously, making Queqiao highly versatile. The review paper addresses other important design considerations for Queqiao and future relay satellites, such as the use of regenerative forwarding, the various link data rates involved, and data storage systems for when no Earth ground station is accessible.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">- Over two years of exploration, a great amount of data has been received from the rover and lander through Queqiao. &quot;Scientists in both China and other countries have conducted analysis and research based on the retrieved data, and they have produced valuable scientific results. The longer the operational life of Queqiao, the more scientific outcomes will be achieved,&quot; remarks Dr. Zhang. Based on current predictions, Queqiao should be operable on mission orbit for at least five years.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">- Dr. Zhang also addressed the prospects for future lunar missions and how relay communication systems should evolve to support them. Many unexplored areas on the Moon, such as the largest crater at the South Pole, call for multiple relay satellites to maintain constant communication links, which poses an expensive and time-consuming challenge. But what if relay satellites were suitable for more than a single mission?</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">- &quot;A sustainable communication and navigation infrastructure should be established to benefit all lunar missions rather than dealing with each mission independently,&quot; comments Dr. Zhang,</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">- &quot;This infrastructure should adopt an open and extensible architecture and provide flexible, interoperable, cross-supportable, and compatible communications services, which are critical to the success of future lunar explorations.&quot; It&#x27;s likely that future endeavors on the far side of the Moon will be a test on how well we can cooperate to unveil the secrets of our natural satellite.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">• November 26, 2019: The three antennas on the Dutch-Chinese radio telescope, which is currently located behind the moon, have been unfolded. This was officially announced today by the Dutch team. The Netherlands-China Low Frequency Explorer (NCLE) hung in space waiting for over a year. This was longer than initially planned, as the accompanying communications satellite had to assist a Chinese lunar lander for a longer time. <sup><a href="#foot87%29" id="footback87)">87)</a></sup> <sup><a href="#foot88%29" id="footback88)">88)</a></sup></p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">- The Chinese satellite was previously mainly seen as a communications satellite. However, the Chinese moon mission has by now achieved its primary goals. Consequently, the Chinese have redefined the satellite to be a radio observatory. As such, the Netherlands-China Low Frequency Explorer is the first Dutch-Chinese space observatory for radio astronomy.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">- Marc Klein Wolt, Managing Director of the Radboud Radio Lab and leader of the Dutch team, is happy: “Our contribution to the Chinese Chang’e -4 mission has now increased tremendously. We have the opportunity to perform our observations during the fourteen-day-long night behind the moon, which is much longer than was originally the idea. The moon night is ours, now.”</p><figure class="css-1gm22d1"><div class="css-1fri2vb"><img src="https://eoportal.org/ftp/satellite-missions/c/Chang-e4_050122/Chang-e4_Auto11.jpeg" alt="Figure 49: The unfolding of one of the three antennas.

Bertels: “The launch eighteen months ago was already extremely thrilling, of course, but we had no hand in it. Now that our own instrument was concerned, things were rather different.”</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">- Albert-Jan Boonstra of ASTRON is pleased to see that the antennas have been unfolded after three years of hard work: “This is a unique demonstration of technology that paves the way for future radio instruments in space.”</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">- Heino Falcke of Radboud University and scientific leader of the Dutch-Chinese radio telescope can barely wait to get his hands on the first measurements. “We are finally in business and have a radio-astronomy instrument of Dutch origin in space. The team has worked incredibly hard, and the first data will reveal how well the instrument truly performs.”</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">- The longer stay behind the moon most probably did have an effect on the antennas. At first, the antennas unfolded smoothly, but as the process progressed, it became increasingly difficult. The team therefore decided to collect data first and perhaps unfold the antennas further at a later point in time. With these shorter antennas, the instrument is sensitive to signals from around 800 million years after the Big Bang. Once unfolded to their full length, they will be able to capture signals from just after the Big Bang.</p><h3 class="chakra-heading css-jnz50r" id="netherlands-china-low-frequency-explorer"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#netherlands-china-low-frequency-explorer"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Netherlands-China Low Frequency Explorer</h3><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">- The Netherlands-China Low Frequency Explorer (NCLE) is a prototype radio telescope built to record weak radio signals from a period just following the Big Bang, called the Dark Ages. These signals are blocked by the Earth’s atmosphere, which is why the telescope was placed on a satellite and brought to a location behind the moon. With this satellite, called QueQiao, the China National Space Administration (CNSA) has been navigating a lunar lander that has been driving around the back of the moon since early 2019. The Netherlands-China Low Frequency Explorer was developed in the Netherlands by Radboud University (Nijmegen), ASTRON (Dwingeloo) and the ISISpace company (Delft), with support from the Netherlands Space Office.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">• August 2019: The first switch on of the NCLE instrument happened 22 January 2019, where a first initial sanity check was performed to verify the instrument had survived the launch, transit to lunar orbit, and 9 months in lunar orbit (Ref. <a href="#spHIT1218Herb">100)</a>.</p><figure class="css-1gm22d1"><div class="css-1fri2vb"><img src="https://eoportal.org/ftp/satellite-missions/c/Chang-e4_050122/Chang-e4_Auto10.jpeg" alt="Figure 50: Current used by the NCLE instrument (image credit: ISIS, Radboud University, Astron)" loading="lazy"/></div><figcaption class="chakra-text css-loagik"><span>Figure 50: Current used by the NCLE instrument (image credit: ISIS, Radboud University, Astron)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">- Figure <a href="#tIKIT13a4Herb">50</a> shows the power drawn by the NCLE instrument, which is seen to increase as progressively more subsystems are switched on. From this figure we can clearly see that at t=120 seconds the switch-on was commenced, by powering up the DRS OCXO clock. After that the other subsystems were switched on one by one. The current drawn by the system is exactly at the level what it should be, signaling the start of commissioning.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">- Currently, the instrument is undergoing a month worth of observations with antenna’s in stowed configuration to characterize the noise over an entire lunar orbit. After this, the antennas will be deployed up to 0.5 meter, after which they will be extended slowly up to the total 5 meters.</p><h3 class="chakra-heading css-jnz50r" id="future-roadmap"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#future-roadmap"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Future Roadmap</h3><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">- NCLE is not supposed to be the last step in the quest to observe the early universe. Rather, it is considered to be a steppingstone mission towards more advanced missions and instruments. It all starts with the initial NCLE mission as described in this paper.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">- This will be followed by not only developing the instrument, but a complete platform as well. These satellites will also be deployed into Lunar orbit to take full advantage of the lessons learnt during the development of this instrument.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">- The last step is to have multiple of these satellites not only in lunar orbit, but even further out. The combination of these instruments at locations which are far apart will provide an excellent baseline to perform interferometer making all measurements even more precise.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">- Currently, the 2nd phase has just started with a phase A study.

While in orbit, the relay satellite can see both the Earth and the far side of the Moon. The satellite can stay in the Halo orbit for a long time due to its relatively low use of fuel, since the Earth&#x27;s and Moon&#x27;s gravity balances the orbital motion of the satellite.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">- &quot;From Earth, the orbit looks like a halo of the Moon, which is where it got its name,&quot; said Lihua Zhang, project manager of the relay satellite. He said the Halo orbit was a three-dimensional ,irregular curve. It is extremely difficult and complex to maintain the satellite in orbit. &quot;If there is a tiny disturbance, such as gravitational disturbance from other planets or the Sun, the satellite will leave orbit. The orbit period is about 14 days. According to our current plan, we will conduct orbit maintenance every seven days. It&#x27;s a new type of orbit, we don&#x27;t have any experience. We ran a number of simulations to make sure the design is feasible and reliable,&quot; Zhang added.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">- In order to establish a communication link between Earth and the planned Chang&#x27;e-4 lunar probe, space engineers must keep the satellite stable and control its altitude, angle and speed with high precision.

With the instrument, astronomers want to measure radio waves originating from the period directly after the Big Bang, when the first stars and galaxies were formed.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">Why is it so important for the measuring instruments to be placed behind the Moon? Professor of Astrophysics from Radboud University and ASTRON Heino Falcke: &quot;Radio astronomers study the universe using radio waves, light coming from stars and planets, for example, which are not visible with the naked eye. We can receive almost all celestial radio wave frequencies here on Earth. We cannot detect radio waves below 30 MHz, however, as these are blocked by our atmosphere. It is these frequencies in particular that contain information about the early universe, which is why we want to measure them.&quot;</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs" id="Chang-e4.html.82">Special about the radio antenna is that it will receive low frequency radio waves with a large frequency range. The instrument passed an important risk assessment review by the Chinese space agency at the end of April.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">&quot;In the past this was not possible and therefore a receiver with a narrow frequency band was used, in order to avoid electromagnetic interference of the satellite itself,&quot; explains project leader Albert-Jan Boonstra of ASTRON. &quot;We have now succeeded in avoiding the electromagnetic interference and making a broadband receiver. That is, of course, good news for subsequent missions and can, for example, be used for future nano-satellites.&quot;</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">In 2016, the NSO (Netherlands Space Office) and its Chinese counterpart CNSA signed an agreement to cooperate in this project, which was an elaboration of the Memorandum of Understanding the two space agencies signed the year before during a trade mission in presence of the Chinese President Xi Jinping and the Dutch King Willem Alexander.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">A digital controller unit, designed and supplied by the Somerset West-based SAC (Space Advisory Company), is part of the NCLE (Netherlands-China Low-Frequency Explorer) as a science payload on the Chang’e-4 relay satellite which lifted atop a Long March 4C Rocket from Xichang Satellite Launch Center at 21:28 UTC on Sunday, 21 May 2018. <sup><a href="#foot99%29" id="footback99)">99)</a></sup></p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">While the Chang’e-4 satellite’s main mission is to relay messages between Earth and the Moon, the NCLE instrument will ride along and conduct experiments into deeper space.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">Duncan Stanton, CEO of SAC said that they are ecstatic to be part of such an unique mission and especially proud of their engineering team who proved themselves to be world-class by meeting the ambitious timeline and performance requirements of the project. They may just have embarked on proudly flying the South African flag the furthest ever.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">Stanton continued that the controller unit supplied by them forms a critical part of the digital receiver system for the NCLE instrument. The instrument was built by the Radboud Radio Lab from the Radboud University, the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy (ASTRON), and ISIS (Innovative Solutions In Space) in Delft.

The NCLE instrument consists of three 5-meter long monopole antennas mounted on the Queqiao satellite to measure in the 80 kHz -80 MHz radio frequency range. The instrument is designed to address a multitude of high-profile science cases, but predominantly NCLE will open up the low-frequency regime for radio astronomy and will prepare for the ground-breaking observations of the 21-cm line emission from the Dark Ages and the Cosmic Dawn, considered to be the holy grail of cosmology. <sup><a href="#foot100%29" id="footback100)">100)</a></sup></p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">The main goal of NCLE is to determine the low frequency radio environment at the Earth Moon L2 point. It serves as a stepping stone mission towards low frequency observations, aimed at registering the hydrogen line at different frequencies and thus creating a ‘moving picture’ of the evolution of the early universe.</p><figure class="css-1gm22d1"><div class="css-1fri2vb"><img src="https://eoportal.org/ftp/satellite-missions/c/Chang-e4_050122/Chang-e4_AutoA.jpeg" alt="Figure 57: Science phenomena to be measured (image credit: ISIS, Radboud University, Astron)" loading="lazy"/></div><figcaption class="chakra-text css-loagik"><span>Figure 57: Science phenomena to be measured (image credit: ISIS, Radboud University, Astron)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs" id="Chang-e4.html.84">Dark Ages and Cosmic Dawn: The signature emission from neutral hydrogen at 21 cm shows a spectrum over different redshifts that indicates its cosmic abundance as a function of time. Around the epoch of reionization in the younger universe, which was when neutral hydrogen was re-ionized by radiation from early stars, this signature should show a measurable dependence on redshift as a result in the range from 1 – 80 MHz. The detection or the constraining of this signature will have a strong impact on cosmology and science of the early universe, as it provides information on an epoch in the history of our universe from which we cannot receive much information through other means.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">Solar Bursts: The Sun, our closest star, affects fundamentally the Earth&#x27;s ecosystem and daily life thereby affecting the quality of life on Earth and the performance of technological systems (e.g. power grid). Superimposed on the powerful thermal emissions of the quiet Sun are the intense radio bursts associated with solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CME), clouds of ionized plasma are ejected into interplanetary space. Despite their great importance to Space Weather services, the physical mechanisms governing such events are poorly understood, with the consequence that neither accurate models nor reliable prediction tools exist.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">The Sun often exhibits magnetic activity outside of its photosphere, in the form of rapid reordering of its smaller-scale magnetic field that may be accompanied by mass ejections. These field reconfigurations generate strong radio emission through synchrotron radiation from charged particles in these magnetized regions. The strength of this emission makes this a source that can be investigated by NCLE relatively easily, establishing statistics and correlations over a long observing period.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">Two main types of radio bursts are observed from the Sun particularly in its active state: Type II bursts drive energizing shocks through the solar corona and interplanetary medium (~1000-2000 km/s), and Type III bursts result from mildly relativistic (~0.1 - 0.3 c) electron beams propagating through the corona and interplanetary space that excite plasma waves at the local plasma frequency but do not create a CME. Type II bursts and their ensuing CMEs can be followed by NCLE much further out than the few solar radii possible from the ground because of the ionosphere, see Figure <a href="#8kIIT119cHerb">58</a>.</p><figure class="css-1gm22d1"><div class="css-1fri2vb"><img src="https://eoportal.org/ftp/satellite-missions/c/Chang-e4_050122/Chang-e4_Auto9.jpeg" alt="Figure 58: The frequency ranges of various emission mechanisms in the radio band.

As such, lightning represents one component of Earth-based RFI with a unique signature that is critical for us to understand.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">Auroral Kilometric Radiation / AKR (Earth): Charged particles in the Solar wind are deflected by Earth’s magnetic field. Under certain circumstances, these particles can become temporarily trapped and emit cyclotron radiation at very low frequencies. As this phenomenon arises from the interaction of the Solar wind with the Earth’s magnetic field, measuring AKR allows us to learn about both of these systems.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">Galactic Background: Interaction of cosmic rays (energetic charged particles) with the Galactic magnetic field generates a wide-spectrum Synchrotron background, which is especially prominent in the Galactic plane. Measurement of this spectral component in the form of a multi-frequency sky map helps us to understand the geometry of the Galactic magnetic field and the cosmic ray population in our Galaxy.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">Quasi-Thermal Noise (QTN): Interaction of the instrument antennas with local plasma causes small voltage variations in them, which manifest as an extra noise component in the measurements. The measurement of QTN outside of the strong influence of Earth’s magnetic field enables us to sample local solar wind properties (possibly allowing us to correlate these with solar outburst data), as well as to understand its influence on our other measurements.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">Solar System Planetary Emissions: Analogous to AKR from Earth, the extended magnetospheres of Jupiter and Saturn can trap charged particles from the Solar wind, which proceed to generate low-frequency cyclotron radiation. As with Earth, measuring this AKR helps us to understand the magnetic fields of the most massive planets in the Solar system, as well as the Solar wind itself.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">Bright Radio Transients From Outside The Solar System: There are many possible processes that might generate low-frequency radio emission with a rapidly varying temporal signature. One example is pulsar emission, which tends to have a strong low-frequency component. Fast Radio Bursts, from hitherto unknown origin, are another example. An issue with short pulses at low frequencies is that they get dispersed quite strongly by interstellar propagation. An ability to measure these transients from space at low frequencies offers the opportunity to correlate these detections with Earth-based measurements at higher frequencies. NCLE’s remoteness from Earth and regular occultation by the Moon, combined with its multidirectional sensitivity, should offer us ample opportunities to look for these events.</p><h3 class="chakra-heading css-jnz50r" id="engineering-challenges"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#engineering-challenges"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Engineering Challenges</h3><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">Leaving low Earth Orbit: To support the science cases, there is no choice but to leave the well know low earth orbits and go further out. The NCLE instrument managed to find an agreement with the Chinese CE-4R satellite; a satellite travelling to the Moon Earth L2 point to act as a relay satellite for a rover which will land on the far side of the Moon.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">Because NLCE is part of a larger satellite some of the obvious challenges have already been met. The host spacecraft will provide mechanical, power, communication and thermal interfaces. However, at the start of the project the host was already designed and built meaning the NCLE instrument needed to conform to the design as little changes could be made.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">This proved to be just as challenging as designing without a spacecraft present. The information to and from the Chinese included large uncertainties as the final orbit, orientation of the instrument or configuration of the spacecraft were largely unknown when the NCLE design started. This directly translates to uncertainties in the design.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">Schedule: At the start of the project only a few things were clear; the system must be below 10 kg, below 50 Watts, will orbit the Earth Moon L2 point and the launch will be in May 2018.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">As the project started in earnest May 2016, this left only 2 years to develop build and test the instrument. The whole system architecture tried to follow the CubeSat approach as much as possible; special space rated components could not be procured on time, build and test, test and build and keeping the system as modular as possible to allow for early testing of the different subsystems. This allowed for all parts to be ready in March 2018, less than 2 years after the project started.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">Electromagnetic Interference: The other big challenge for the instrument is to reduce its electromagnetic emissions as much as possible. This was needed to become sky-noise limited and detect the weak signals over the noise the instrument itself is making.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">CubeSats generally are not designed to be as clean as possible from an EMC point of view. Rather, little care is given to this part of the design in typical CubeSat missions. To make matters worse, the interfaces coming from CE-4R also was not designed to be as clean as possible.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">To combat these issues almost the entire power system had to be redesigned from the ground up. Care was taken to implement a star grounding scheme such that all power paths are well defined and controlled. Isolation between the incoming power, analog power and digital domain needed to be carefully created as well.</p><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs" id="Chang-e4.html.86">Using previous CubeSat designs as a blueprint, the power system was designed to be as modular as possible to facility all these requirements. In the end, no less than 4 boards have been designed, tested and integrated together, a far cry from the usual one a typical CubeSat needs!</p><figure class="css-1gm22d1"><div class="css-1fri2vb"><img src="https://eoportal.org/ftp/satellite-missions/c/Chang-e4_050122/Chang-e4_Auto8.jpeg" alt="Figure 59: The electronic box (image credit: ISIS, Radboud University, Astron)" loading="lazy"/></div><figcaption class="chakra-text css-loagik"><span>Figure 59: The electronic box (image credit: ISIS, Radboud University, Astron)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="chakra-text css-lnjjrs">Lastly, the mechanical design had to contain special measures to make sure internal signals wouldn’t radiate to one another.

This lunar exploration mission will incorporate an orbiter, a robotic lander and rover. Chang'e-4 will be China's second lunar lander and rover. The Chang'e-4 lander was a backup to the Chang'e-3 mission, so it will have the same basic structure, but a different scientific payload, holding 11 instruments. \u003csup\u003e\u003ca href=\"#foot1%29\" id=\"footback1)\"\u003e1)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/sup\u003e \u003csup\u003e\u003ca href=\"#foot2%29\" id=\"footback2)\"\u003e2)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith its special environment and complex geological history, the far side of the moon is a hot spot for scientific and space exploration.

In recent years, it has been discovered that the region also contains vast amounts of water ice. These are thought to be the results of impacts by meteors and asteroids which left water ice that survived because of how the region is permanently shadowed. Without direct sunlight, water ice in these craters has not been subject to sublimation and chemical dissociation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"Chang-e4.html.2\"\u003eSince the 1960s, several missions have explored this region from orbit, including the Apollo 15, 16 and 17 missions, the \u003ca href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LRO/multimedia/lroimages/lroc-20100927_southpole.html\" id=\"01FDCNPZRL07L77ISD2P5\"\u003eLRO (Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter)\u003c/a\u003e and India’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.isro.gov.in/Spacecraft/chandrayaan-1\" id=\"01FDCNPZRL07L7UJSD2P6\"\u003eChandrayaan-1\u003c/a\u003e orbiter.

In the highland area, craters and mountains are widely spread. The well-known South-Pole Aitken Basin (SPA) is located in the southern part of the farside, with the central area at latitude 40°–60°S, longitude around 180° and the diameter ranging from 2000–600 km. This is the largest-scaled and eldest impacted basin in the solar system and of high scientific interest. \u003csup\u003e\u003ca href=\"#foot6%29\" id=\"footback6)\"\u003e6)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe farside of the Moon, for its special location, is of unique peculiarity that the nearside cannot match. On one hand, the farside shields all kinds of radio waves emitted from the Earth, thus becomes the best place for cosmic radio spectrum detection. On the other hand, the original information of the Moon is hidden in the largest, deepest and eldest SPA. It is crucial for the study of the history, evolution, composition and components of the deep-layer of both the Moon and the Earth system. Besides, how SPA is formed remains controversial and deserves further research. Soft landing on the SPA as well as rovering exploration of it are of great scientific significance mainly in the following two aspects.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlanetary formation and evolution:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1) The study of SPA may benefit the discovery of material composition of Lunar crust and mantle. So it opens an important window to the study of the deep-layer material composition of the Moon.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e2) SPA is a basin (its altitude is 13 km lower than its surrounding highlands) and of thin crust. Whether in the passive or active modes that bring out the Lunar mare basalt, there should have emerged large amount of basalt in SPA. However, currently obtained data cannot effectively prove that the basin has abundant basalt. On the other hand, absence of basalt may indicate something happened in the process of Lunar thermal evolution and differentiation in early times.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e3) Comparing the craters in SPA with the Lunar mare we can see that the degradation situation of SPA is not obvious. Also no crater with Lunar rays has been discovered. Therefore the formation, evolution, topography and chemical characteristics of craters in the SPA are apparently different from those of other terrains.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cspan tabindex=\"-1\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Figure 1: Elevation diagram of the South-Pole Aitken Basin (scale in km).

But no myriametric wave (\u0026#x3C;30 MHz) has been detected yet. The detection of myriametric wave is of much importance for all-sky imaging obtained by continuous sky scanning of discrete radio source, cosmic dark times study (21 cm radiation in dark times), solar physics, space weather, extreme-high-energy cosmic ray and neutrino study. \u003csup\u003e\u003ca href=\"#foot7%29\" id=\"footback7)\"\u003e7)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInterfered by ionosphere and Earth radio waves, it is impossible to detect myriametric wave on the Earth.

Its scientific objective was to detect the intensity of cosmic ray (0.2–20 MHz). But it was interfered by radio waves in Earth orbit. RAE-B was launched in 1973 and was injected into the lunar orbit, whose scientific objective was to detect the long-wavelength radio waves (working frequency 25 kHz–13.1 MHz).

In the descent process, the length of path of the lander is almost 450 km on the Lunar surface. During this process, the distance and velocity should be measured for navigation of the descent. At the farside of the Moon, the topographic relief is more apparent than that at the nearside, with the topographic elevation difference increased from 3 km to 7 km. The difference brings out the jump of navigation information and extreme difficulties for control strategy. Therefore, the sectional control target and navigation information utilization time as well as navigation algorithm should be optimized to decrease the influence of the great topographic relief.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e2) Decrease of the backscattering coefficient. Research results show that the site on which Change’3 has landed at the nearside of the Moon is opposite to the SPA(South-Pole Aiken) basin at the farside of the Moon, and the contents of FeO and TiO\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e are 15%–25% and 0%–15%, while the average value of them on the nearside of the Moon are 15%–20% more than that on the farside. The low contents of FeO and TiO\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e decrease backscattering coefficient of microwaves and directly influence the echo characteristics of range and velocity microwave sensor (RVS). Therefore, the signal emission energy and signal-noise-ratio should be increased to obtain useful measuring data.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e3) Reducing the distribution of landing sites. Due to the complex terrain of the farside, it is difficult to find out a large flat area. For different launch windows, the landing sites may be widely distributed without precise orbit control and descent process control. Different from Change’3, the circumlunar orbits with various inclination angles for different launch windows are designed for Change’4 specific requirements. Meanwhile, the orbit is carefully regulated in the circumlunar phase. With in-orbit calibration of the 7500 N thrust-variance engine, the powered descent process path is precisely controlled and the landing sites are reduced to a flat and small area.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"rtg-radioisotope-thermoelectric-generator-and-thermoelectric-technology\"\u003e\u003ca class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#rtg-radioisotope-thermoelectric-generator-and-thermoelectric-technology\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"icon icon-link\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003eRTG (Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator) and Thermoelectric Technology\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor data collection of the temperature of the Lunar soil in moon night, the temperature sensor has to have a power supply. Currently, the most realistic method is to utilize the RTG, which is based on the Seebeck principle to transform the heat energy into the electric energy. When generating electric power, the RTG can also supply great heat energy to regulate temperature. Generally Pu-238 is used as the RTG source (Ref. \u003ca href=\"#yAK$R11d0Herb\"\u003e2)\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCompared with the RTG used in Change’3, the thermoelectric module should be increased in the RTG of Change’4, which may mean various technical difficulties, including high-performance thermoelectric material manufacture, high-performance thermoelectric components design and assembly, high-efficiency heat transformation, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1) High-performance thermoelectric material manufacture technology. Thermoelectric material is the core material in the RTG. The electric and mechanical performance and the thermal stability directly determine the reliability and stability of the RTG. Currently, PbTe and CoSb\u003csub\u003e3\u003c/sub\u003e are used, while PbTe is well developed but with lesser performance. For further design, the chemical dose ratio adjustment, the doping impurity selection and manufacture process should be optimized to make the material meet the engineering requirement.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e2) High-performance thermoelectric components design and assembly technology. The thermoelectric components are comprised of π type pairs of the P-type and N-type materials and directly determine key parameters such as the output voltage, the inner resistor and the output power of the RTG. The design and assembly of the energy transfer components determine the reliability, including the components joint process design, the matching design for the thermal expansion coefficient of the electrode material and substrate material and the shelter layer and transition layer optimization. For future improvements, the different temperatures in both nighttime and daytime on the Moon should be considered. Calculation, simulation, test and verification should be done to satisfy engineering requirements.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e3) High-efficiency thermoelectric transformation technology. The thermoelectric transformation efficiency and decay rate of the RTG directly determines the lifetime and the performance of the RTG and is a vital segment for the success of the mission in moon night. The key technology is thermal flow design of the RTG, which aims to maximize the heat transformation from thermoelectric components to heat collector. Meanwhile, the RTG shell should have the layer of high emission ratio and low-absorption ratio to ensure the safe of RTG under the high temperature at Lunar daytime.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor decades, this basin has been a source of fascination for scientists; and in recent years, multiple missions have confirmed the existence of water ice in the region. Determining the extent of the water ice is one of the main focuses of the rover mission component. However, the lander will also to be equipped with an aluminum case filled with insects and plants that will test the effects of lunar gravity on terrestrial organisms.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese studies will play a key role in China’s long-term plans to mount crewed missions to the Moon, and the possible construction of a lunar outpost.

Xie said potatoes could be a major source of food for future space travelers. The growth period of Arabidopsis, a small flowering plant related to cabbage and mustard, is short and easy to observe. Yeast could play a role in regulating carbon dioxide and oxygen in the mini biosphere, and the fruit fly would be the consumer of the photosynthesis process.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e- Researchers used biological technology to render the seeds and eggs dormant during the two months when the probe went through the final checks in the launch center and journey of more than 20 days through space.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e- After Chang'e-4 landed on the far side of the moon on 3 January, the ground control center instructed the probe to water the plants to start the growing process.

For the second objective, LND is capable to measure particle fluxes and their temporal variations and thus will contribute to the understanding of particle propagation and transport in the heliosphere. Its stack of 10 silicon solid-state detectors (SSDs) allows to measure protons from 10-30 MeV, electrons from 60-500 keV, alpha particles from 10-20 MeV/n and heavy ions from 15-40 MeV/n. In addition, LND can measure fast neutrons in the energy range from 1-20 MeV and, using two Gd-sandwich detectors, measure fluxes of thermal neutrons, which are sensitive to subsurface water and important for understanding lunar surface mixing processes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInstrument concept: The zenith-pointing LND is mounted inside the payload compartment of the Chang’E 4 lander and consists of a thermally decoupled sensor head and an electronics box (Figure \u003ca href=\"#9H1UR12b5Herb\"\u003e33\u003c/a\u003e). The sensor head consists of a stack of 10 SSDs (Figure 4) as well as two Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs). One PCB is used to pre-amplify the detector signals, the other PCB contains shaper circuits and the Analog to Digital Converters (ADCs). These digitized signals are sent from the sensor head to the electronics box which accumulates the data into histograms, count rates, PHA words, etc., packetizes them and sends them to the Instrument Control Unit (ICU). The latter serves as the electrical and data interface with the lander.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cspan tabindex=\"-1\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Figure 33: Left: The sensor head of LND; Right: The electronics box of LND (image credit: LND Team)\" src=\"https://eoportal.org/ftp/satellite-missions/c/Chang-e4_050122/Chang-e4_Auto21.jpeg\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cspan\u003eFigure 33: Left: The sensor head of LND; Right: The electronics box of LND (image credit: LND Team)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp id=\"Chang-e4.html.57\"\u003eMeasuring fast neutrons: Fast neutrons are generated by the interaction of the galactic cosmic rays with the lunar regolith and are an important source of the radiation dose reaching the interior of an astronaut’s body.

The innermost segment of the C detector in Figure \u003ca href=\"#tX1UR197Herb\"\u003e34\u003c/a\u003e, C1, measures neutral radiation in anti-coincidence with all outer segments (B1\u0026#x26;B2, D1\u0026#x26;D2, C2).

As shown in Fig. 4, LND is basically a telescope consisting of ten segmented SSDs (A-J). Three detectors (B, C, and D) are packed as close together as possible to measure neutrons in the energy range 1-20 MeV (see section 3). The lower six detectors (E-J) are mounted in two different sandwich configurations. In one each sandwich clamps a very thin (~20 µm) Gd foil (shown in red) to detect thermal neutrons. To discriminate thermal neutrons which are emitted from the lunar soil (and are thus sensitive to the subsurface proton (water) content), the GH sandwich is shielded from above by a thicker Gd foil which is encased in two thick Al sheets. The GH sandwich then measures thermal neutrons from below and the EF sandwich thermal neutrons from above. The lowermost sandwich is a copy of the IRAS BCsandwich and serves as the final detector in the stack. The J detector serves as an anticoincidence to discriminate stopping particles from penetrating ones.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cspan tabindex=\"-1\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Figure 35: The particle telescope of LND (image credit: LND Team)\" src=\"https://eoportal.org/ftp/satellite-missions/c/Chang-e4_050122/Chang-e4_Auto1F.jpeg\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cspan\u003eFigure 35: The particle telescope of LND (image credit: LND Team)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eMeasuring thermal neutrons using Gd converters: Natural gadolinium (Gd) has a very large cross section for thermal neutrons (48’890 b).

This proved useful in the early lunar landing missions in the 20th century, as there was always a direct line of sight for uninterrupted radiocommunications between Earth ground stations and equipment on the Moon. However, gravitational locking makes exploring the hidden face of the moon - the far side - much more challenging, because signals cannot be sent directly across the Moon towards Earth. \u003csup\u003e\u003ca href=\"#foot85%29\" id=\"footback85)\"\u003e85)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"Chang-e4.html.73\"\u003e- Still, in January 2019, China's lunar probe Chang'e-4 marked the first time a spacecraft landed on the far side of the Moon. Both the lander and the lunar rover it carried have been gathering and sending back images and data from previously unexplored areas. But how does Chang'e-4 probe communicate with the Earth? The answer is Queqiao, a relay communications satellite, explains Dr. Lihua Zhang from DFH Satellite Co., Ltd., China.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e- As explained by Dr. Zhang in a review paper recently published in Space: Science and Technology, Queqiao is an unprecedented satellite designed specifically for one purpose: to act as a bridge between Chang'e-4 probe and the Earth. Queqiao was launched in 2018 and put into orbit around a point 'behind' the Moon. \u003csup\u003e\u003ca href=\"#foot86%29\" id=\"footback86)\"\u003e86)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e- This point is known as the Earth-Moon Libration point 2, where a special case of gravitational balance allows Queqiao to maintain an orbit such that it has almost constant direct line of sight with both the far side of the Moon and the Earth. Getting the satellite into this peculiar orbit required careful planning and maintenance management, and the success of this operation set a precedent for future attempts at putting satellites in orbit around other Earth-Moon libration points.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e- From its stable place in space, Queqiao helped guide the soft-landing and surface operations of Chang'e-4 probe and has been our intermediary with it ever since. The satellite is equipped with two different kinds of antennas: a parabolic antenna and several spiral antennas. The former, which has a large diameter of 4.2 m, was designed to send and receive signals on the X-band (7-8 GHz) to and from the rover and lander on the surface of the Moon. Its large size is related the expected noise levels and the low intensity of the transmissions that are sent by surface equipment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e- On the other hand, the spiral antennas operate on the S-band (2-4 GHz) and communicate with Earth ground stations, forwarding commands to the lunar surface equipment and exchanging telemetry and tracking data. Most notably, all these different links can transmit and receive simultaneously, making Queqiao highly versatile. The review paper addresses other important design considerations for Queqiao and future relay satellites, such as the use of regenerative forwarding, the various link data rates involved, and data storage systems for when no Earth ground station is accessible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e- Over two years of exploration, a great amount of data has been received from the rover and lander through Queqiao. \"Scientists in both China and other countries have conducted analysis and research based on the retrieved data, and they have produced valuable scientific results. The longer the operational life of Queqiao, the more scientific outcomes will be achieved,\" remarks Dr. Zhang. Based on current predictions, Queqiao should be operable on mission orbit for at least five years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e- Dr. Zhang also addressed the prospects for future lunar missions and how relay communication systems should evolve to support them. Many unexplored areas on the Moon, such as the largest crater at the South Pole, call for multiple relay satellites to maintain constant communication links, which poses an expensive and time-consuming challenge. But what if relay satellites were suitable for more than a single mission?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e- \"A sustainable communication and navigation infrastructure should be established to benefit all lunar missions rather than dealing with each mission independently,\" comments Dr. Zhang,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e- \"This infrastructure should adopt an open and extensible architecture and provide flexible, interoperable, cross-supportable, and compatible communications services, which are critical to the success of future lunar explorations.\" It's likely that future endeavors on the far side of the Moon will be a test on how well we can cooperate to unveil the secrets of our natural satellite.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e• November 26, 2019: The three antennas on the Dutch-Chinese radio telescope, which is currently located behind the moon, have been unfolded.

Bertels: “The launch eighteen months ago was already extremely thrilling, of course, but we had no hand in it. Now that our own instrument was concerned, things were rather different.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e- Albert-Jan Boonstra of ASTRON is pleased to see that the antennas have been unfolded after three years of hard work: “This is a unique demonstration of technology that paves the way for future radio instruments in space.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e- Heino Falcke of Radboud University and scientific leader of the Dutch-Chinese radio telescope can barely wait to get his hands on the first measurements. “We are finally in business and have a radio-astronomy instrument of Dutch origin in space. The team has worked incredibly hard, and the first data will reveal how well the instrument truly performs.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e- The longer stay behind the moon most probably did have an effect on the antennas. At first, the antennas unfolded smoothly, but as the process progressed, it became increasingly difficult. The team therefore decided to collect data first and perhaps unfold the antennas further at a later point in time. With these shorter antennas, the instrument is sensitive to signals from around 800 million years after the Big Bang. Once unfolded to their full length, they will be able to capture signals from just after the Big Bang.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"netherlands-china-low-frequency-explorer\"\u003e\u003ca class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#netherlands-china-low-frequency-explorer\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"icon icon-link\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003eNetherlands-China Low Frequency Explorer\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e- The Netherlands-China Low Frequency Explorer (NCLE) is a prototype radio telescope built to record weak radio signals from a period just following the Big Bang, called the Dark Ages.

With this satellite, called QueQiao, the China National Space Administration (CNSA) has been navigating a lunar lander that has been driving around the back of the moon since early 2019.

While in orbit, the relay satellite can see both the Earth and the far side of the Moon. The satellite can stay in the Halo orbit for a long time due to its relatively low use of fuel, since the Earth's and Moon's gravity balances the orbital motion of the satellite.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e- \"From Earth, the orbit looks like a halo of the Moon, which is where it got its name,\" said Lihua Zhang, project manager of the relay satellite. He said the Halo orbit was a three-dimensional ,irregular curve. It is extremely difficult and complex to maintain the satellite in orbit. \"If there is a tiny disturbance, such as gravitational disturbance from other planets or the Sun, the satellite will leave orbit. The orbit period is about 14 days. According to our current plan, we will conduct orbit maintenance every seven days. It's a new type of orbit, we don't have any experience. We ran a number of simulations to make sure the design is feasible and reliable,\" Zhang added.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e- In order to establish a communication link between Earth and the planned Chang'e-4 lunar probe, space engineers must keep the satellite stable and control its altitude, angle and speed with high precision. Next, the team will test the communication function of the relay satellite.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e- With a mass of 400 kg, and with a design life of three years, the satellite carries several antennas. One, shaped like an umbrella with a diameter of 4.2 meters, is the largest communication antenna ever used in deep space exploration, this according to Lan Chen, deputy chief engineer of the Xi'an Branch of CAST.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e- Tidal forces of the Earth have slowed the Moon's rotation to the point where the same side always faces the Earth, a phenomenon called tidal locking. The other face, most of which is never visible from Earth, is the far side or dark side of the Moon, not because it's dark, but because most of it remains unknown. With its special environment and complex geological history, the far side is a hot spot for scientific and space exploration. The Aitken Basin of the lunar south pole region on the far side has been chosen as the landing site for Chang'e-4.

Professor of Astrophysics from Radboud University and ASTRON Heino Falcke: \"Radio astronomers study the universe using radio waves, light coming from stars and planets, for example, which are not visible with the naked eye. We can receive almost all celestial radio wave frequencies here on Earth. We cannot detect radio waves below 30 MHz, however, as these are blocked by our atmosphere.

Around the epoch of reionization in the younger universe, which was when neutral hydrogen was re-ionized by radiation from early stars, this signature should show a measurable dependence on redshift as a result in the range from 1 – 80 MHz. The detection or the constraining of this signature will have a strong impact on cosmology and science of the early universe, as it provides information on an epoch in the history of our universe from which we cannot receive much information through other means.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSolar Bursts: The Sun, our closest star, affects fundamentally the Earth's ecosystem and daily life thereby affecting the quality of life on Earth and the performance of technological systems (e.g. power grid). Superimposed on the powerful thermal emissions of the quiet Sun are the intense radio bursts associated with solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CME), clouds of ionized plasma are ejected into interplanetary space. Despite their great importance to Space Weather services, the physical mechanisms governing such events are poorly understood, with the consequence that neither accurate models nor reliable prediction tools exist.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Sun often exhibits magnetic activity outside of its photosphere, in the form of rapid reordering of its smaller-scale magnetic field that may be accompanied by mass ejections. These field reconfigurations generate strong radio emission through synchrotron radiation from charged particles in these magnetized regions. The strength of this emission makes this a source that can be investigated by NCLE relatively easily, establishing statistics and correlations over a long observing period.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTwo main types of radio bursts are observed from the Sun particularly in its active state: Type II bursts drive energizing shocks through the solar corona and interplanetary medium (~1000-2000 km/s), and Type III bursts result from mildly relativistic (~0.1 - 0.3 c) electron beams propagating through the corona and interplanetary space that excite plasma waves at the local plasma frequency but do not create a CME.

As such, lightning represents one component of Earth-based RFI with a unique signature that is critical for us to understand.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAuroral Kilometric Radiation / AKR (Earth): Charged particles in the Solar wind are deflected by Earth’s magnetic field. Under certain circumstances, these particles can become temporarily trapped and emit cyclotron radiation at very low frequencies. As this phenomenon arises from the interaction of the Solar wind with the Earth’s magnetic field, measuring AKR allows us to learn about both of these systems.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGalactic Background: Interaction of cosmic rays (energetic charged particles) with the Galactic magnetic field generates a wide-spectrum Synchrotron background, which is especially prominent in the Galactic plane. Measurement of this spectral component in the form of a multi-frequency sky map helps us to understand the geometry of the Galactic magnetic field and the cosmic ray population in our Galaxy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eQuasi-Thermal Noise (QTN): Interaction of the instrument antennas with local plasma causes small voltage variations in them, which manifest as an extra noise component in the measurements. The measurement of QTN outside of the strong influence of Earth’s magnetic field enables us to sample local solar wind properties (possibly allowing us to correlate these with solar outburst data), as well as to understand its influence on our other measurements.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSolar System Planetary Emissions: Analogous to AKR from Earth, the extended magnetospheres of Jupiter and Saturn can trap charged particles from the Solar wind, which proceed to generate low-frequency cyclotron radiation. As with Earth, measuring this AKR helps us to understand the magnetic fields of the most massive planets in the Solar system, as well as the Solar wind itself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBright Radio Transients From Outside The Solar System: There are many possible processes that might generate low-frequency radio emission with a rapidly varying temporal signature. One example is pulsar emission, which tends to have a strong low-frequency component. Fast Radio Bursts, from hitherto unknown origin, are another example. An issue with short pulses at low frequencies is that they get dispersed quite strongly by interstellar propagation. An ability to measure these transients from space at low frequencies offers the opportunity to correlate these detections with Earth-based measurements at higher frequencies. NCLE’s remoteness from Earth and regular occultation by the Moon, combined with its multidirectional sensitivity, should offer us ample opportunities to look for these events.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"engineering-challenges\"\u003e\u003ca class=\"anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#engineering-challenges\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"icon icon-link\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003eEngineering Challenges\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eLeaving low Earth Orbit: To support the science cases, there is no choice but to leave the well know low earth orbits and go further out. The NCLE instrument managed to find an agreement with the Chinese CE-4R satellite; a satellite travelling to the Moon Earth L2 point to act as a relay satellite for a rover which will land on the far side of the Moon.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause NLCE is part of a larger satellite some of the obvious challenges have already been met. The host spacecraft will provide mechanical, power, communication and thermal interfaces. However, at the start of the project the host was already designed and built meaning the NCLE instrument needed to conform to the design as little changes could be made.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis proved to be just as challenging as designing without a spacecraft present. The information to and from the Chinese included large uncertainties as the final orbit, orientation of the instrument or configuration of the spacecraft were largely unknown when the NCLE design started. This directly translates to uncertainties in the design.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSchedule: At the start of the project only a few things were clear; the system must be below 10 kg, below 50 Watts, will orbit the Earth Moon L2 point and the launch will be in May 2018.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs the project started in earnest May 2016, this left only 2 years to develop build and test the instrument. The whole system architecture tried to follow the CubeSat approach as much as possible; special space rated components could not be procured on time, build and test, test and build and keeping the system as modular as possible to allow for early testing of the different subsystems. This allowed for all parts to be ready in March 2018, less than 2 years after the project started.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eElectromagnetic Interference: The other big challenge for the instrument is to reduce its electromagnetic emissions as much as possible. This was needed to become sky-noise limited and detect the weak signals over the noise the instrument itself is making.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCubeSats generally are not designed to be as clean as possible from an EMC point of view. Rather, little care is given to this part of the design in typical CubeSat missions. To make matters worse, the interfaces coming from CE-4R also was not designed to be as clean as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo combat these issues almost the entire power system had to be redesigned from the ground up. Care was taken to implement a star grounding scheme such that all power paths are well defined and controlled.
