	SSW is a collection of common data management and analysis routines derived from the Yohkoh and SOHO missions, the 
	Solar Data Analysis Center, the astronomy libraries and other packages. The SSW environment is designed to provide 
	a consistent look and feel at co-investigator institutions and facilitate sharing and exchange of data. The SSW 
	system minimizes the learning curve when doing research away from the home institution or when correlating results 
	from multiple experiments.",
