	abstract = {The propagation of 15 interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) from Earth's orbit (1 AU) to Mars (∼1.5 AU) has been studied with their propagation speed estimated from both measurements and simulations. The enhancement of magnetic fields related to ICMEs and their shock fronts causes the so-called Forbush decrease, which can be detected as a reduction of galactic cosmic rays measured on ground. We have used galactic cosmic ray (GCR) data from in situ measurements at Earth, from both STEREO A and STEREO B as well as GCR measurements by the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) instrument on board Mars Science Laboratory on the surface of Mars. A set of ICME events has been selected during the periods when Earth (or STEREO A or STEREO B) and Mars locations were nearly aligned on the same side of the Sun in the ecliptic plane (so-called opposition phase). Such lineups allow us to estimate the ICMEs' transit times between 1 and 1.5 AU by estimating the delay time of the corresponding Forbush decreases measured at each location. We investigate the evolution of their propagation speeds before and after passing Earth's orbit and find that the deceleration of ICMEs due to their interaction with the ambient solar wind may continue beyond 1 AU. We also find a substantial variance of the speed evolution among different events revealing the dynamic and diverse nature of eruptive solar events. Furthermore, the results are compared to simulation data obtained from two CME propagation models, namely the Drag-Based Model and ENLIL plus cone model.},

	abstract = {Abstract The Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) instrument onboard the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) 
	mission's Curiosity rover has been measuring galactic cosmic rays (GCR) as well as solar energetic particles (SEP) 
	on the surface of Mars for more than 6 years since its landing in August 2012. The observations include a large 
	number of Forbush decreases (FD) caused by interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) and/or their associated 
	shocks shielding away part of the GCR particles with their turbulent and enhanced magnetic fields while passing 
	Mars. This study combines MSL/RAD FD measurements and remote tracking of ICMEs using the Solar TErrestrial 
	RElations Observatory (STEREO) Heliospheric Imager (HI) telescopes in a statistical study for the first time. The 
	large data set collected by HI makes it possible to analyze 149 ICMEs propagating toward MSL both during its 
	8-month cruise phase and after its landing on Mars. We link 45 of the events observed at STEREO-HI to their 
	corresponding FDs at MSL/RAD and study the accuracy of the ICME arrival time at Mars predicted from HI data using 
	different methods. The mean differences between the predicted arrival times and those observed using FDs range from 
	−11–5 hr for the different methods, with standard deviations between 17 and 20 hr. These values for predictions at 
	Mars are very similar compared to other locations closer to the Sun and also comparable to the precision of some 
	other modeling approaches.},

	abstract = {
	Forbush decreases (FDs), which are short-term drops in the flux of galactic cosmic rays (GCR), are caused by the
	shielding from strong and/or turbulent magnetic structures in the solar wind, especially interplanetary coronal mass
	ejections (ICMEs) and their associated shocks, as well as corotating interaction regions (CIRs). Such events can be
	observed at Earth, e.g. using neutron monitors, but also at many other locations in the solar system, such as on the
	surface of Mars with the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) instrument onboard Mars Science Laboratory (MSL). They
	are often used as a proxy for detecting the arrival of ICMEs or CIRs, especially when sufficient in situ solar wind
	measurements are not available.
	We compare the properties of FDs observed at Earth and Mars, focusing on events produced by ICMEs.
	We find that FDs at both locations show a correlation between their total amplitude and the maximum hourly decrease,
	but with different proportionality factors. We explain this difference using theoretical modelling approaches
	and suggest that it is related to the size increase of ICMEs, and in particular their sheath regions, en route from
	Earth to Mars. From the FD data, we can derive the sheath broadening factor to be between about 1.5 and 1.9, agreeing
	with our theoretical considerations. This factor is also in line with previous measurements of the sheath evolution
	closer to the Sun.
