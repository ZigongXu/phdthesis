  abstract = 	{Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are clouds of plasma and magnetic field regularly ejected from the Sun at high speeds that propagate out into interplanetary space. These events are one of the most important space weather phenomena.
Their strong and turbulent magnetic field can cause disruptions of spacecraft electronics as well as terrestrial infrastructure, and they can be associated with the acceleration of energetic particles, which may cause increased radiation exposure, e.g. for astronauts.
To be able to validate and consequently improve theoretical models predicting the arrival of interplanetary CMEs (ICMEs) at Earth and other locations in the heliosphere, it is important to employ many different data sources measuring the various signatures of ICMEs at different locations, so that their temporal and radial evolution can be studied. These investigations are also significantly aided by observations from remote sensing telescopes, which can directly observe the global structure of the ICMEs and track them out to large radial distances.

The studies presented in this thesis introduce Mars into the framework of routinely available locations for the in situ observation of space weather. Here, ICMEs can be detected using Forbush decrease measurements by the Radiation Assessment Detector onboard the Mars Science Laboratory rover Curiosity. Forbush decreases are short-term decreases in the galactic cosmic ray flux caused by the magnetic structure of the ICME partly shielding away the cosmic rays.
The measurements of these Forbush decreases are utilized in this thesis to determine ICME arrival times for statistical studies of events seen at two planets, Earth and Mars, or at one of the two STEREO spacecraft and Mars, during close longitudinal alignment.
The measurements show for the first time that fast ICMEs can continue to decelerate beyond the orbit of Earth due to their interaction with the slower ambient solar wind.
Using remote sensing observations from the STEREO heliospheric imagers, we study additional ICMEs that hit Mars and benchmark the accuracy of different approaches for the analysis of these heliospheric imager data.
Subsequently, the Forbush decrease data for the thereby cataloged events are further investigated to infer not only the arrival time, but also more information about the radial evolution of the ICME properties by comparison with analytical modeling approaches.

Finally, two case studies are performed: First, the major space weather events of September 2017 and their impact on Mars are examined, including the investigation of the solar energetic particle events and three associated CMEs that interacted and merged on their way towards Mars. Second, the first in situ observations of an ICME at the Solar Orbiter spacecraft, which launched in February 2020, are presented. In this study, we describe the capabilities of the Solar Orbiter's High Energy Telescope for high-resolution observations of Forbush decreases and use its measurements in combination with a reverse modeling approach to show that the expansion of the ICME was non-uniform, possibly due to interaction with a following solar wind stream interaction region.},

	abstract = {The propagation of 15 interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) from Earth's orbit (1 AU) to Mars (∼1.5 AU) has been studied with their propagation speed estimated from both measurements and simulations. The enhancement of magnetic fields related to ICMEs and their shock fronts causes the so-called Forbush decrease, which can be detected as a reduction of galactic cosmic rays measured on ground. We have used galactic cosmic ray (GCR) data from in situ measurements at Earth, from both STEREO A and STEREO B as well as GCR measurements by the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) instrument on board Mars Science Laboratory on the surface of Mars. A set of ICME events has been selected during the periods when Earth (or STEREO A or STEREO B) and Mars locations were nearly aligned on the same side of the Sun in the ecliptic plane (so-called opposition phase). Such lineups allow us to estimate the ICMEs' transit times between 1 and 1.5 AU by estimating the delay time of the corresponding Forbush decreases measured at each location. We investigate the evolution of their propagation speeds before and after passing Earth's orbit and find that the deceleration of ICMEs due to their interaction with the ambient solar wind may continue beyond 1 AU. We also find a substantial variance of the speed evolution among different events revealing the dynamic and diverse nature of eruptive solar events. Furthermore, the results are compared to simulation data obtained from two CME propagation models, namely the Drag-Based Model and ENLIL plus cone model.},

	abstract = {Abstract The Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) instrument onboard the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) 
	mission's Curiosity rover has been measuring galactic cosmic rays (GCR) as well as solar energetic particles (SEP) 
	on the surface of Mars for more than 6 years since its landing in August 2012. The observations include a large 
	number of Forbush decreases (FD) caused by interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) and/or their associated 
	shocks shielding away part of the GCR particles with their turbulent and enhanced magnetic fields while passing 
	Mars. This study combines MSL/RAD FD measurements and remote tracking of ICMEs using the Solar TErrestrial 
	RElations Observatory (STEREO) Heliospheric Imager (HI) telescopes in a statistical study for the first time. The 
	large data set collected by HI makes it possible to analyze 149 ICMEs propagating toward MSL both during its 
	8-month cruise phase and after its landing on Mars. We link 45 of the events observed at STEREO-HI to their 
	corresponding FDs at MSL/RAD and study the accuracy of the ICME arrival time at Mars predicted from HI data using 
	different methods. The mean differences between the predicted arrival times and those observed using FDs range from 
	−11--5 hr for the different methods, with standard deviations between 17 and 20 hr. These values for predictions at 
	Mars are very similar compared to other locations closer to the Sun and also comparable to the precision of some 
	other modeling approaches.},

@article{Forstner-2020,
	abstract = {Forbush decreases (FDs), which are short-term drops in the flux of galactic cosmic rays (GCR), are caused by the shielding from strong and/or turbulent magnetic structures in the solar wind, especially interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) and their associated shocks, as well as corotating interaction regions (CIRs). Such events can be observed at Earth, e.g. using neutron monitors, but also at many other locations in the solar system, such as on the surface of Mars with the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) instrument onboard Mars Science Laboratory (MSL). They are often used as a proxy for detecting the arrival of ICMEs or CIRs, especially when sufficient in situ solar wind measurements are not available. We compare the properties of FDs observed at Earth and Mars, focusing on events produced by ICMEs. We find that FDs at both locations show a correlation between their total amplitude and the maximum hourly decrease, but with different proportionality factors. We explain this difference using theoretical modelling approaches and suggest that it is related to the size increase of ICMEs, and in particular their sheath regions, en route from Earth to Mars. From the FD data, we can derive the sheath broadening factor to be between about 1.5 and 1.9, agreeing with our theoretical considerations. This factor is also in line with previous measurements of the sheath evolution closer to the Sun.},

As the solar particle event flux was gradually declining, a shock front reached Mars and caused a sudden drop of about 15\% in instantaneous dose rates. No solar particles followed the shock arrival, and the magnetic shielding of galactic cosmic rays by the shock reduced their intensity to levels below those seen before the start of the event.

	abstract = {On 10 September 2017, solar energetic particles originating from the active region 12673 produced a ground level enhancement at Earth. The ground level enhancement on the surface of Mars, 160 longitudinally east of Earth, observed by the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) was the largest since the landing of the Curiosity rover in August 2012. Based on multipoint coronagraph images and the Graduated Cylindrical Shell model, we identify the initial 3-D kinematics of an extremely fast coronal mass ejection (CME) and its shock front, as well as another two CMEs launched hours earlier with moderate speeds. The three CMEs interacted as they propagated outward into the heliosphere and merged into a complex interplanetary CME (ICME). The arrival of the shock and ICME at Mars caused a very significant Forbush decrease seen by RAD only a few hours later than that at Earth, which was about 0.5 AU closer to the Sun. We investigate the propagation of the three CMEs and the merged ICME together with the shock, using the drag-based model and the WSA-ENLIL plus cone model constrained by the in situ observations. The synergistic study of the ICME and solar energetic particle arrivals at Earth and Mars suggests that to better predict potentially hazardous space weather impacts at Earth and other heliospheric locations for human exploration missions, it is essential to analyze (1) the eruption of the flare and CME at the Sun, (2) the CME kinematics, especially during their interactions, and (3) the spatially and temporally varying heliospheric conditions, such as the evolution and propagation of the stream interaction regions.},

	in the upper corona and that beyond a certain distance the dynamics becomes governed solely by the interaction of 
	the ICME and the ambient solar wind. In particular, we consider the option where the drag acceleration has a 
	quadratic dependence on the ICME relative speed, which is expected in a collisionless environment, where the drag 
	is caused primarily by emission of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves. In this paper we present the simplest version

	ICME transit time and impact speed. This offers easy handling and straightforward application to real-time

	abstract = {Abstract Numerous solar flares and coronal mass ejection-induced interplanetary shocks associated with solar active region AR12673 caused disturbances to terrestrial high-frequency (HF, 3--30 MHz) radio communications from 4--14 September 2017. Simultaneously, Hurricanes Irma and Jose caused significant damage to the Caribbean Islands and parts of Florida. The coincidental timing of both the space weather activity and hurricanes was unfortunate, as HF radio was needed for emergency communications. This paper presents the response of HF amateur radio propagation as observed by the Reverse Beacon Network and the Weak Signal Propagation Reporting Network to the space weather events of that period. Distributed data coverage from these dense sources provided a unique mix of global and regional coverage of ionospheric response and recovery that revealed several features of storm time HF propagation dynamics. X-class flares on 6, 7, and 10 September caused acute radio blackouts during the day in the Caribbean with recovery times of tens of minutes to hours, based on the decay time of the flare. A severe geomagnetic storm with Kpmax = 8+ and SYM-Hmin = −146 nT occurring 7--10 September wiped out ionospheric communications first on 14 MHz and then on 7 MHz starting at ∼1200 UT 8 September. This storm, combined with affects from additional flare and geomagnetic activity, contributed to a significant suppression of effective HF propagation bands both globally and in the Caribbean for a period of 12 to 15 days.},

@article{Bland-2018,
	abstract = {Abstract Two solar proton events in September 2017 had a significant impact on the operation of the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN), a global network of high-frequency (HF) radars designed for observing F region ionospheric plasma convection. Strong polar cap absorption caused near-total loss of radar backscatter, which prevented the primary SuperDARN data products from being determined for a period of several days. During this interval, the high-latitude and polar cap radars measured unusually low levels of background atmospheric radio noise. We demonstrate that these background noise measurements can be used to observe the spatial and temporal evolution of the polar cap absorption region, using an approach similar to riometry. We find that the temporal evolution of the SuperDARN radar-derived HF attenuation closely follows that of the cosmic noise absorption measured by a riometer. Attenuation of the atmospheric noise up to 10 dB at 12 MHz is measured within the northern polar cap, and up to 14 dB in the southern polar cap, which is consistent with the observed backscatter loss. Additionally, periods of enhanced attenuation lasting 2--4 hr are detected by the midlatitude radars in response to M- and X-class solar flares. Our results demonstrate that SuperDARN's routine measurements of atmospheric radio noise can be used to monitor 8- to 20-MHz radio attenuation from middle to polar latitudes, which may be used to supplement riometer data and also to investigate the causes of SuperDARN backscatter loss during space weather events.},

	abstract = {Abstract On 6 September 2017, an X-class flare of the magnitude 9.3 occurred around noon UT, being the strongest flare event in a decade. The flare itself was the highlight of a quite interesting phase of solar-terrestrial interactions caused by the active region known as the Catania sunspot group 46 or active region number 2673 on the NOAA catalog. From 3 to 13 September 2017 strong flare activities occurred, accompanied by a number of radio bursts and earthward-directed coronal mass ejections. Solar wind influences at Earth were modest during the flare activity and limited to the polar regions (Linty et al., 2018, 10.1029/2018SW001940). But, the strong X9.3 flare itself had impacts on the dayside ionosphere causing some problems in navigation services as we present within this paper. The event data observed and analyzed give us the opportunity to improve our understanding of strong and extreme space weather events and allow us to distinguish between the influence of the different event classes on our technological infrastructure within periods of strong solar activity. Here we will discuss our observations with special focus on the X9.3 flare event and provide examples how the flare itself influenced services in the domains of aviation and maritime navigation in the European sector.},

	abstract = {Abstract During the intense solar radio bursts on 6 September 2017, Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signal interferences were observed at ground stations in the European longitude sector from 20$\,^{\circ}$N to 70$\,^{\circ}$N for all GNSS satellites in view including GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo. The solar radio noise reduced the signal-to-noise ratio with clear frequency dependence. The impact of the radio burst has been found at L2 and L5 frequencies, but not at L1 frequency. The ground observation of the solar radio spectrum between 1.0 and 2.0 GHz corresponds well to such frequency dependence. The maximum signal-to-noise ratio reduction of -10 dB was found when the solar radio flux was pulsating around 2,000 solar flux unit level. Precise point positioning results show that accuracy is reduced with stronger deviation for dual-frequency solutions than for single-frequency solutions based on L1 signal only. The positioning error refers rather to the solar extreme ultraviolet flare than to solar radio interferences. The results presented here are a clear indication of frequency-dependent GNSS performance degradation during strong space weather events.},

	widely used approach of an initially empty, closed magnetic structure (i.e., flux rope) that fills up slowly with 
	particles by perpendicular diffusion. The model is restricted to explaining only the depression caused by the 
	magnetic structure of the interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME). We use remote CME observations and a 3D 
	reconstruction method (the graduated cylindrical shell method) to constrain initial boundary conditions of the FD 
	model and take into account CME evolutionary properties by incorporating flux rope expansion. Several flux rope 
	expansion modes are considered, which can lead to different FD characteristics. In general, the model is 
	qualitatively in agreement with observations, whereas quantitative agreement depends on the diffusion coefficient 
	and the expansion properties (interplay of the diffusion and expansion). A case study was performed to explain the 
	FD observed on 2014 May 30. The observed FD was fitted quite well by ForbMod for all expansion modes using only the 
	diffusion coefficient as a free parameter, where the diffusion parameter was found to correspond to an expected

	abstract = {Cosmic ray variations due to changes in the magnetosphere are evaluated for severe magnetic storm on 20 
	November 2003 using data from the worldwide neutron monitor network and the global survey method. From these 
	results the changes in the planetary distribution of magnetic cutoff rigidities during this disturbed period are 
	obtained in dependence of latitude. A correlation between Dst index and cutoff rigidity variations was defined for 
	each cosmic ray station. The maximum changes in cutoff rigidities occurred while Dst index was around −472 nT. 
	Geomagnetic effect in cosmic ray intensity reached at some stations 6--8\%, and it seems to be the greatest one over 
	the history of neutron monitor observations. The latitudinal distribution shows a maximum changes at geomagnetic 
	cutoff rigidities around 7--8 GV. This corresponds to unusually low latitudes for maximal effect. Cutoff rigidity 
	variations were also calculated utilizing the last model of Tsyganenko for a disturbed magnetosphere (T01S). A 
	comparison between experimental and modeling results revealed a big discrepancy at cutoff rigidities less than 6 
	GV. The results on the geomagnetic effect in cosmic rays can be used for validating magnetospheric field models 
	during very severe storms.},

@article{Xu-2020-LND-SEP,
	abstract = {On 2019 May 6 the Lunar Lander Neutron & Dosimetry (LND) Experiment on board the Chang'E-4 lander on the far-side of the Moon detected its first solar energetic particle (SEP) event with proton energies up to 21 MeV. Combined proton energy spectra are studied based on the LND, SOHO/EPHIN, and ACE/EPAM measurements, which show that LND could provide a complementary data set from a special location on the Moon, contributing to our existing observations and understanding of space environment. We applied velocity dispersion analysis to the impulsive electron event and weak proton enhancement and show that electrons are released only 22 minutes after the flare onset and ∼15 minutes after the type II radio burst, while protons are released more than one hour after the electron release. The beam-like in situ electrons and clear velocity dispersion indicate a good magnetic connection between the source and Earth. This is remarkable because stereoscopic remote-sensing observations from Earth and STEREO-A suggest that the SEPs are associated with an active region nearly 113$\,^{\circ}$ away from the magnetic footpoint of Earth. This suggests that these SEPs did not propagate along the nominal Parker spiral normally assumed for ballistic mapping and that the release and propagation mechanism of electrons and protons are likely to differ significantly for this event.},

@phdthesis{Elftmann-2020-PhD,
	abstract = {The Solar Orbiter spacecraft of the European Space Agency ESA was successfully launched on the 10th of February 2020 from Cape Canaveral, USA. During the seven-year nominal mission phase, it will travel as close as 0.27 astronomical units to the Sun to study it from up-close. Solar Orbiter will help to address open scientific questions concerning the physical processes on the surface and within the Sun. For this purpose, the spacecraft is equipped with several scientific instruments, divided into remote sensing and in-situ instrumentation. One of these instruments is the Energetic-Particle-Detector (EPD), consisting of four individual telescopes: the Suprathermal Electron and Proton - telescope (STEP), the Electron and Proton Telescope (EPT), the Suprathermal Ion Spectrograph (SIS), and the High Energy Telescope (HET). HET measures electrons with energies between 0.45 up to 18 MeV, protons with energies between 7 to 105 MeV and heavy ions in the range of 7 to several hundred MeV/nuc. It also identifies individual particle and ion species and achieves a separation for 3He and 4He isotopes of up to a 1{\%} ratio. With that, HET measures the energy-dependent particle composition of solar energetic particle events in the given energy ranges and provides insight into their acceleration and propagation processes. 
	In this work, the onboard data processing of HET is developed. It defines the available scientific data for the characterization of the measured particle environment. 
	As part of the pre-development studies, the influence of the instrument's temperature on the measurement of heavy ions with HET's scintillation crystal is investigated. The analysis has shown, that the non-linearity in light output, called ionization quenching, is independent of temperature in case of the scintillation material used in HET. Ionization quenching originates from high ionization densities in the scintillation material when detecting heavy ions. The results are published in form of a peer-reviewed paper in Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section B: Beam Interactions with Materials and Atoms", Volume 451 (2019). Based on these results, existing ionization quenching prediction models can be used for the development of the onboard data processing. 
	Due to the limited available telemetry bandwidth of Solar Orbiter, it is necessary to categorize and evaluate measured data prior to transmission to Earth. Since this is a sophisticated compression process, a detailed description of the onboard data processing, developed in the scope of this thesis, is provided. The performed simulations, describing the interaction of energetic charged particles with HET, which are essential for the development of HET's onboard data processing are presented in detail. Based on the simulation data, the onboard data processing of HET is developed. The resulting procedures analyze measured particles and assign them to pre-defined histograms based on the particle's energy and species. Based on these histograms, data products are defined, which provide selected parts of these histograms in pre-defined cadences. The necessary conversion factors for inferring the measured particle environment based on the defined data products are calculated and provided as part of this thesis. 
	According to the developed data products and their calculated conversion factors, the capabilities of HET for the detection of solar energetic particle events are investigated and presented using simulations of the expected spectral properties
	and particle compositions, as well as using measurements of instruments of previous missions. 
	The onboard data processing of HET and the defined data products are validated, based on experiments at a heavy ion acceleration facility and the first mission data. From the first data measured by HET during the mission in a real isotropic particle environment, it can be concluded, that HET delivers the expected data and performs as expected in most aspects. Based on this data, optimizations of the onboard data processing are developed in the scope of this thesis and are installed on the HET instrument. 
	In addition to the primary scientific results, e.g. the temperature independence of ionization quenching, this work provides a complete documentation of HET, containing essential information for scientists to understand and correctly interpret the data measured by HET and to develop further optimizations of the onboard data processing if necessary .},

	abstract = {Mars as a future target of manned exploration is a place of particular interest in the solar system. Both the past and the present habitability of Mars, and the safety of astronauts working on the Martian surface, depend, among other factors, on the ionizing radiation present on its surface.
	
	As part of the Mars Science Laboratory mission, the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD). One of the scientific goals being addressed by the instrument is to aid in the validation of particle transport models used to simulate the radiation environment on the Martian surface. This thesis aims to address this goal in particular.
	
	Global dust storms are a meteorological feature that is unique to Mars. These storms produce a striking difference in the appearance of the planet, obscuring almost all of its surface beneath a dense layer of dust. In order to predict the changes in radiation environment, simulations comparing a global dust storm to normal atmospheric conditions are performed. Additionally, an attempt is made to validate the results of the simulations using a period of enhanced dust activity that is included in the RAD measurement time.
	
	The Martian radiation environment is dominated by downward particle fluxes of Galactic Cosmic Rays and the secondary particles produced by them. Near the Martian surface, an upward-directed component composed of secondary particles produced in the Martian soil adds to the total radiation environment. In order to fully characterize the radiation environment, this upward component must be understood as well. A method for discriminating particle directionality in RAD for charged particles is developed through simulations and validated through instrument observations. The RAD instrument is unable to determine directionality for neutrons due to its design. However, since neutrons are important for dosimetry, an instrument design capable of measuring neutron directionality is described and its basic capabilities assessed.},

	abstract = {The Mars Science Laboratory rover Curiosity, operating on the surface of Mars, is exposed to radiation fluxes from above and below. Galactic Cosmic Rays travel through the Martian atmosphere, producing a modified spectrum consisting of both primary and secondary particles at ground level. These particles produce an upward directed secondary particle spectrum as they interact with the Martian soil. Here we develop a method to distinguish the upward and downward directed particle fluxes in the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) instrument, verify it using data taken during the cruise to Mars, and apply it to data taken on the Martian surface. We use a combination of Geant4 and Planetocosmics modeling to find discrimination criteria for the flux directions. After developing models of the cruise phase and surface shielding conditions, we compare model-predicted values for the ratio of upward to downward flux with those found in RAD observation data. Given the quality of available information on Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft and rover composition, we find generally reasonable agreement between our models and RAD observation data. This demonstrates the feasibility of the method developed and tested here. We additionally note that the method can also be used to extend the measurement range and capabilities of the RAD instrument to higher energies.},

	abstract = {We present a forward-modeling technique for flux rope-like CMEs using an empirically defined model of a 
    flux rope, the graduated cylindrical shell (GCS). To compare it with white-light coronagraph observations, we 
    assume an electron distribution through the GCS and derive synthetic images in total and polarized brightness for 
    various projections of the model using a Thomson scattering ray-tracing program. We test our forward modeling 
    technique on 34 LASCO CMEs analyzed by Cremades & Bothmer. We are able to reproduce the CME morphology and derive 
    the electron density (at the CME front) of these events using multi-instrument observations (MDI, Hα, EIT, LASCO) 
    under the assumption of self-similar expansion. This study suggests that a flux rope-like structure is a good 
    description for these events. We also find that we need to invoke a deflection and/or rotation of the structure 
    relative to the position and orientation of the source region in most cases. Finally, we demonstrate an original 
    technique to fit the electron density of the CME leading edge. We find that, on average, the peak of the density at 
    the CME front is 7.5 times that in the equatorial model of Saito et al., and can reach ~22 times the model in some

	abstract = {Solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are closely coupled through magnetic reconnection. CMEs are usually accelerated impulsively within the low solar corona, synchronized with the impulsive flare energy release. We investigate the dynamic evolution of a fast CME and its associated X2.8 flare occurring on 2013 May 13. The CME experiences two distinct phases of enhanced acceleration, an impulsive one with a peak value of ∼5  km s−2, followed by an extended phase with accelerations up to 0.7  km s−2. The two-phase CME dynamics is associated with a two-episode flare energy release. While the first episode is consistent with the ``standard'' eruption of a magnetic flux rope, the second episode of flare energy release is initiated by the reconnection of a large-scale loop in the aftermath of the eruption and produces stronger nonthermal emission up to γ-rays. In addition, this long-duration flare reveals clear signs of ongoing magnetic reconnection during the decay phase, evidenced by extended hard X-ray bursts with energies up to 100--300 keV and intermittent downflows of reconnected loops for >4 hr. The observations reveal that the two-step flare reconnection substantially contributes to the two-phase CME acceleration, and the impulsive CME acceleration precedes the most intense flare energy release. The implications of this non-standard flare/CME observation are discussed.},

@article{Richardson-Cane-1995,
	abstract = {Occurrences of solar wind plasma with abnormally low proton temperatures (Tp) have long been associated with the interplanetary manifestations (which we term ``ejecta'') of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). We survey the National Space Science Data Center Omni solar wind database for 1965--1991, and data from the Helios 1 and 2 spacecraft for more limited periods, to identify plasma in which Tp is less than the temperature expected (Tex) from the well-established correlation between the solar wind speed and Tp for normal solar wind expansion. The occurrence rate of low-temperature plasma (specifically with Tp/Tex ≤ 0.5) is shown to be correlated with solar activity levels. Individual low-temperature regions have durations from 1 to ∼80 hours with a mean of ∼10 hours. Around one third are encounters with the heliospheric plasma sheet (HPS). These events are observed most frequently during the increasing phase of solar activity when the HPS lies closer to the ecliptic. The abnormally low temperatures may be intrinsic to the HPS or may provide support for the proposal that the coronal streamer belt underlying the HPS is a frequent source of ejecta. The remaining events have an occurrence rate which shows a particularly clear correlation with solar activity levels and with the CME rate at the Sun (when CME observations are available), consistent with an association with ejecta. These events also show greater than chance associations with other ejecta signatures. We suggest that the Omni plasma data can provide information on the rate of ejecta passing the Earth, and hence give an indication of the CME rate, for a period commencing before spacecraft coronagraph CME observations became available in the early 1970s. Our findings suggest that Tp depressions may provide a more comprehensive indication of the presence of ejecta than other ejecta signatures, such as bidirectional solar wind electron heat fluxes and energetic ion flows, which alone do not identify all ejecta.},

@article{Haberle-2014,
	abstract = {Abstract We provide a preliminary interpretation of the Rover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS) pressure data from the first 100 Martian solar days (sols) of the Mars Science Laboratory mission. The pressure sensor is performing well and has revealed the existence of phenomena undetected by previous missions that include possible gravity waves excited by evening downslope flows, relatively dust-free convective vortices analogous in structure to dust devils, and signatures indicative of the circulation induced by Gale Crater and its central mound. Other more familiar phenomena are also present including the thermal tides, generated by daily insolation variations, and the CO2 cycle, driven by the condensation and sublimation of CO2 in the polar regions. The amplitude of the thermal tides is several times larger than those seen by other landers primarily because Curiosity is located where eastward and westward tidal modes constructively interfere and also because the crater circulation amplifies the tides to some extent. During the first 100 sols tidal amplitudes generally decline, which we attribute to the waning influence of the Kelvin wave. Toward the end of the 100 sol period, tidal amplitudes abruptly increased in response to a nearby regional dust storm that did not expand to global scales. Tidal phases changed abruptly during the onset of this storm suggesting a change in the interaction between eastward and westward modes. When compared to Viking Lander 2 data, the REMS daily average pressures show no evidence yet for the 1--20 Pa increase expected from the possible loss of CO2 from the south polar residual cap.},

@article{Eyles-2003-SMEI,
	abstract = {We describe an instrument (SMEI) which has been specifically designed to detect and forecast the arrival 
	of solar mass ejections and other heliospheric structures which are moving towards the Earth. Such events may cause 
	geomagnetic storms, with resulting radiation hazards and disruption to military and commercial communications; 
	damage to Earth-orbiting spacecraft; and also terrestrial effects such as surges in transcontinental power 
	transmission lines. The detectors are sensitive over the optical wave-band, which is measured using CCD cameras. 
	SMEI was launched on 6 January 2003 on the Coriolis spacecraft into a Sun-synchronous polar orbit as part of the US 
	DoD Space Test Programme. The instrument contains three cameras, each with a field of view of 
	60{\textdegree}{\texttimes}3{\textdegree}, which are mounted onto the spacecraft such that they scan most of the 
	sky every 102-min orbit. The sensitivity is such that changes in sky brightness equivalent to a tenth magnitude 
	star in one square degree of sky may be detected. Each camera takes an image every 4 s. The normal telemetry rate 
	is 128 kbits s−1. In order to extract the emission from a typical large coronal mass ejection, stellar images and 
	the signal from the zodiacal dust cloud must be subtracted. This requires accurate relative photometry to 0.1{\%}. 
	One consequence is that images of stars and the zodiacal cloud will be measured to this photometric accuracy once 
	per orbit. This will enable studies of transient zodiacal cloud phenomena, flare stars, supernovae, comets, and 
	other varying point-like objects.},

    Laboratory (USA), the Lockheed Solar and Astrophysics Laboratory (USA), the Goddard Space Flight Center (USA), the 
    University of Birmingham (UK), the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (UK), the Max Planck Institute for Solar System 
    Research (Germany), the Centre Spatiale de Leige (Belgium), the Institut d'Optique (France) and the Institut 
    d'Astrophysique Spatiale (France). SECCHI comprises five telescopes, which together image the solar corona from the 
    solar disk to beyond 1 AU. These telescopes are: an extreme ultraviolet imager (EUVI: 1--1.7 R⊙), two traditional 
    Lyot coronagraphs (COR1: 1.5--4 R⊙ and COR2: 2.5--15 R⊙) and two new designs of heliospheric imagers (HI-1: 15--84 
    R⊙ and HI-2: 66--318 R⊙). All the instruments use 2048{\texttimes}2048 pixel CCD arrays in a backside-in mode. The 
    EUVI backside surface has been specially processed for EUV sensitivity, while the others have an anti-reflection 
    coating applied. A multi-tasking operating system, running on a PowerPC CPU, receives commands from the spacecraft, 
    controls the instrument operations, acquires the images and compresses them for downlink through the main science 
    channel (at compression factors typically up to 20{\texttimes}) and also through a low bandwidth channel to be used 
    for space weather forecasting (at compression factors up to 200{\texttimes}). An image compression factor of about 
    10{\texttimes} enable the collection of images at the rate of about one every 2--3 minutes. Identical instruments, 
    except for different sizes of occulters, are included on the STEREO-A and STEREO-B spacecraft.},

	wide-angle visible-light imagers that incorporate sufficient baffling to eliminate scattered light to the extent 
	that the passage of solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) through the heliosphere can be detected. Each HI instrument

	abstract = {We have developed a new technique for tracking white-light coronal intensity features and have used 
	this technique to construct continuous height/time maps of coronal ejecta as they move outward through the 2--30 Rs 
	field of view of the Large-Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) 
	spacecraft. Displayed as gray-scale images, these height/time maps provide continuous histories of the motions 
	along selected radial paths in the corona and reveal a variety of accelerating and decelerating features, including 
	two principal types of coronal mass ejections (CMEs): (1) Gradual CMEs, apparently formed when prominences and 
	their cavities rise up from below coronal streamers: When seen broadside, these events acquire balloon-like shapes 
	containing central cores, and their leading edges accelerate gradually to speeds in the range 400--600 km/s before 
	leaving the 2--30 Rs field of view. The cores fall behind with speeds in the range 300--400 km/s. Seen along the line 
	of sight, these events appear as smooth halos around the occulting disk, consistent with head-on views of optically 
	thin bubbles stretched out from the Sun. At the relatively larger radial distances seen from this ``head-on'' 
	perspective, gradually accelerating CMEs fade out sooner and seem to reach a constant speed more quickly than when 
	seen broadside. Some suitably directed gradual CMEs are associated with interplanetary shocks and geomagnetic 
	storms. (2) Impulsive CMEs, often associated with flares and Moreton waves on the visible disk: When seen 
	broadside, these CMEs move uniformly across the 2--30 Rs field of view with speeds typically in excess of 750 km/s. 
	At the relatively larger radial distances seen from a head-on perspective, impulsive events tend to have a more 
	ragged structure than the gradual CMEs and show clear evidence of deceleration, sometimes reducing their speeds 
	from 1000 to 500 km/s in 1 hour. Such decelerations are too large to represent ballistic motions in the Sun's 
	gravitational field but might be caused by shock waves, sweeping up material far from the Sun.},

	abstract = {Plasma parcels are observed propagating from the Sun out to the large coronal heights monitored by the 
	Heliospheric Imagers (HI) instruments onboard the NASA STEREO spacecraft during September 2007. The source region 
	of these out-flowing parcels is found to corotate with the Sun and to be rooted near the western boundary of an 
	equatorial coronal hole. These plasma enhancements evolve during their propagation through the HI cameras' fields 
	of view and only becoming fully developed in the outer camera field of view. We provide evidence that HI is 
	observing the formation of a Corotating Interaction Region (CIR) where fast solar wind from the equatorial coronal 
	hole is interacting with the slow solar wind of the streamer belt located on the western edge of that coronal hole. 
	A dense plasma parcel is also observed near the footpoint of the observed CIR at a distance less than 0.1AU from 
	the Sun where fast wind would have not had time to catch up slow wind. We suggest that this low-lying plasma 
	enhancement is a plasma parcel which has been disconnected from a helmet streamer and subsequently becomes embedded 
	inside the corotating interaction region.},

	abstract = {Since the advent of wide-angle imaging of the inner heliosphere, a plethora of techniques have been 
	developed to investigate the three-dimensional structure and kinematics of solar wind transients, such as coronal 
	mass ejections, from their signatures in single- and multi-spacecraft imaging observations. These techniques, which 
	range from the highly complex and computationally intensive to methods based on simple curve fitting, all have 
	their inherent advantages and limitations. In the analysis of single-spacecraft imaging observations, much use has 
	been made of the fixed phi fitting (FPF) and harmonic mean 
	fitting (HMF) techniques, in which the solar wind transient is considered to be a radially propagating point source 
	(fixed phi , FP, model) and a radially expanding circle 
	anchored at Sun centre (harmonic mean, HM, model), respectively. Initially, we compare the radial speeds and 
	propagation directions derived from application of the FPF and HMF techniques to a large set of STEREO 
	/Heliospheric Imager (HI) observations. As the geometries on which these two techniques are founded constitute 
	extreme descriptions of solar wind transients in terms of their extent along the line of sight, we describe a 
	single-spacecraft fitting technique based on a more generalized model for which the FP and HM geometries form the 
	limiting cases. In addition to providing estimates of a transient's speed and propagation direction, the 
	self-similar expansion fitting (SSEF) technique provides, in theory, the capability to estimate the transient's 
	angular extent in the plane orthogonal to the field of view. Using the HI observations, and also by performing a 
	Monte Carlo simulation, we assess the potential of the SSEF technique.},

@article{Liu-2010b-triangulation,
	abstract = {We reconstruct the global structure and kinematics of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) using coordinated imaging 
	and in situ observations from multiple vantage points. A forward modeling technique, which assumes a rope-like 
	morphology for CMEs, is used to determine the global structure (including orientation and propagation direction) from 
	coronagraph observations. We reconstruct the corresponding structure from in situ measurements at 1 AU with the 
	Grad-Shafranov method, which gives the flux-rope orientation, cross section, and a rough knowledge of the propagation 
	direction. CME kinematics (propagation direction and radial distance) during the transit from the Sun to 1 AU are

	14-16 and 2008 December 12 CMEs. This merged imaging and in situ study shows important consequences and implications

	have a large deviation from that determined by coronagraph image modeling; and (5) we find, for the first time, that

	heliocentric distances (0.3--1 AU) to investigate the propagation of ICMEs in the inner heliosphere and determine 
	how the generic features of ICMEs change with heliospheric distance. Using data from the MErcury Surface, Space 
	ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER), Venus Express and ACE spacecraft, we analyze with the 
	superposed epoch technique the profiles of ICME substructures, namely, the sheath and the magnetic ejecta. We 
	determine that the median magnetic field magnitude in the sheath correlates well with ICME speeds at 1 AU, and we 
	use this proxy to order the ICMEs at all spacecraft. We then investigate the typical ICME profiles for three 
	categories equivalent to slow, intermediate, and fast ICMEs. Contrary to fast ICMEs, slow ICMEs have a weaker solar 
	wind field at the front and a more symmetric magnetic field profile. We find the asymmetry to be less pronounced at 
	Earth than at Mercury, indicating a relaxation taking place as ICMEs propagate. We also find that the magnetic 
	field intensities in the wake region of the ICMEs do not go back to the pre-ICME solar wind intensities, suggesting 
	that the effects of ICMEs on the ambient solar wind last longer than the duration of the transient event. Such 
	results provide an indication of physical processes that need to be reproduced by numerical simulations of ICME

@article{Manchester2005,
	abstract = {Most high-energy solar energetic particles are believed to be accelerated at shock waves driven by coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The acceleration process strongly depends on the shock geometry and the structure of the sheath that forms behind the shock. In an effort to understand the structure and time evolution of such CME-driven shocks and their relevance to particle acceleration, we investigate the interaction of a fast CME with the ambient solar wind by means of a three-dimensional numerical ideal MHD model. Our global steady state coronal model possesses high-latitude coronal holes and a helmet streamer structure with a current sheet near the equator, reminiscent of near solar minimum conditions. Fast and slow solar winds flow at high and low latitude, respectively, and the Archimedean spiral geometry of the interplanetary magnetic field is reproduced by solar rotation. Within this model system, we drive a CME to erupt by introducing a Gibson-Low magnetic flux rope that is embedded in the helmet streamer in an initial state of force imbalance. The flux rope rapidly expands and is ejected from the corona with maximum speeds in excess of 1000 km s-1, driving a fast-mode shock from the inner corona to a distance of 1 AU. We find that the ambient solar wind structure strongly affects the evolution of the CME-driven shocks, causing deviations of the fast-mode shocks from their expected global configuration. These deflections lead to substantial compressions of the plasma and magnetic field in their associated sheath region. The sudden postshock increase in magnetic field strength on low-latitude field lines is found to be effective for accelerating particles to the GeV range.},

The contribution of solar flare protons to the lower-energy data from the IMP cosmic ray telescopes was carefully removed. We found that the rigidity dependences of the magnitudes of the July 1981, July 1982, and February 1986 Forbush decreases for P ≥ 2 GV were given by exp (−1/P0.75), exp (−1/P0.6), and exp (−1/P1.0), respectively. For 0.5 ≤ P ≤ 2 GV the magnitude of the Forbush decreases in July 1981 and July 1982 was rigidity independent. The February 1986 event also appeared to be rigidity independent below ∼1 GV. The characteristic recovery time of these Forbush decreases was found to be not strongly rigidity dependent. These results on the rigidity dependence of Forbush decreases for 0.5 < P < 20 GV are discussed in the context of proposed models.},

	abstract = {A study of the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field during four geomagnetic storms shows that strong southward interplanetary magnetic fields are associated with the development of each main phase. Weak southward magnetic fields do not necessarily lead to an increase in the ring current even though such southward fields persist. Such behavior is consistent with the existence of a threshold for the initiation of strengthening of the ring current. These data also suggest that if the threshold is exceeded and the southward field attains a new constant level, Dst will decrease until some saturation value is reached. This apparent threshold for the interplanetary magnetic field and the saturation level for Dst can be explained by a ring current injection process, which is a function of the interplanetary magnetic (or electric) field, and by a ring current dissipation process, which is a function of the strength of the ring current.},

@article{Cargill-1996,
	abstract = {Magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the evolution of a flux tube accelerated through a stationary magnetized plasma are presented. As the flux tube moves through the external plasma, its shape becomes distorted and reconnection can take place between the flux tube and external fields. The coupling between the moving flux tube and the external plasma is generally efficient, with simulated flux tube velocities many times smaller than those expected from frictionless motion. The reconnection between the flux tube and external field takes place when there is a unidirectional external field component in the direction of flux tube propagation. The reconnection is intrinsically nonsymmetric around the flux tube boundary. The principal reconnection site is at the rear of the flux tube, where strong vortices convect the external field toward the flux tube. Drag coefficients (CD) that parameterize this interaction have been determined. When the flux tube is continually accelerated, CD > 1 is appropriate, consistent with previously used ad hoc values. Examples of when the flux tube is accelerated for a short time but allowed to continue interacting with the external plasma are presented. It is shown that in the absence of reconnection, the coupling time is several Alfv{\'e}n wave transit times across the flux tube. However, when reconnection takes place, this coupling can cease to occur, and the flux tube may move frictionlessly (CD ≈ O). The results are discussed in terms of interplanetary magnetic clouds, and it is suggested that the observations of comoving coronal mass ejection and solar wind plasma can be accounted for by drag between the two.},

@article{Dumbovic-2018,
	abstract = {The drag-based model for heliospheric propagation of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is a widely used analytical model that can predict CME arrival time and speed at a given heliospheric location. It is based on the assumption that the propagation of CMEs in interplanetary space is solely under the influence of magnetohydrodynamical drag, where CME propagation is determined based on CME initial properties as well as the properties of the ambient solar wind. We present an upgraded version, the drag-based ensemble model (DBEM), that covers ensemble modeling to produce a distribution of possible ICME arrival times and speeds. Multiple runs using uncertainty ranges for the input values can be performed in almost real-time, within a few minutes. This allows us to define the most likely ICME arrival times and speeds, quantify prediction uncertainties, and determine forecast confidence. The performance of the DBEM is evaluated and compared to that of ensemble WSA-ENLIL+Cone model (ENLIL) using the same sample of events. It is found that the mean error is ME = −9.7 hr, mean absolute error MAE = 14.3 hr, and root mean square error RMSE = 16.7 hr, which is somewhat higher than, but comparable to ENLIL errors (ME = −6.1 hr, MAE = 12.8 hr and RMSE = 14.4 hr). Overall, DBEM and ENLIL show a similar performance. Furthermore, we find that in both models fast CMEs are predicted to arrive earlier than observed, most likely owing to the physical limitations of models, but possibly also related to an overestimation of the CME initial speed for fast CMEs.},

	abstract = {Fast and accurate prediction of the arrival time of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) at Earth is vital to minimize hazards caused by CMEs. In this paper, we use a deep-learning framework, i.e., a convolutional neural network (CNN) regression model, to analyze transit times from the Sun to Earth of 223 geoeffective CME events observed in the past 30 yr. 90\% of them were used to build the prediction model, and the rest 10\% have been used for test purpose. Unlike previous studies on this topic, our proposed CNN regression model does not require manually selected features for model training, it does not need time spent on feature collection, and it can deliver predictions without deeper expert knowledge. The only input to our CNN regression model is the instances of the white-light observations of CMEs. The mean absolute error of the constructed CNN regression model is about 12.4 hr, which is comparable to the average performance of the previous studies on this subject. As more CME data become available, we expect the CNN regression model will reveal better results.},

@article{Kusano-2012,
	abstract = {Solar flares and coronal mass ejections, the most catastrophic eruptions in our solar system, have been known to affect terrestrial environments and infrastructure. However, because their triggering mechanism is still not sufficiently understood, our capacity to predict the occurrence of solar eruptions and to forecast space weather is substantially hindered. Even though various models have been proposed to determine the onset of solar eruptions, the types of magnetic structures capable of triggering these eruptions are still unclear. In this study, we solved this problem by systematically surveying the nonlinear dynamics caused by a wide variety of magnetic structures in terms of three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations. As a result, we determined that two different types of small magnetic structures favor the onset of solar eruptions. These structures, which should appear near the magnetic polarity inversion line (PIL), include magnetic fluxes reversed to the potential component or the nonpotential component of major field on the PIL. In addition, we analyzed two large flares, the X-class flare on 2006 December 13 and the M-class flare on 2011 February 13, using imaging data provided by the Hinode satellite, and we demonstrated that they conform to the simulation predictions. These results suggest that forecasting of solar eruptions is possible with sophisticated observation of a solar magnetic field, although the lead time must be limited by the timescale of changes in the small magnetic structures.},

@article{Gopalswamy-2001,
	abstract = {We describe an empirical model to predict the 1-AU arrival of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). This model is based on an effective interplanetary (IP) acceleration described by Gopalswamy et al. [2000b] that the CMEs are subject to, as they propagate from the Sun to 1 AU. We have improved this model (1) by minimizing the projection effects (using data from spacecraft in quadrature) in determining the initial speed of CMEs, and (2) by allowing for the cessation of the interplanetary acceleration before 1 AU. The resulting effective IP acceleration was higher in magnitude than what was obtained from CME measurements from spacecraft along the Sun-Earth line. We evaluated the predictive capability of the CME arrival model using recent two-point measurements from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), Wind, and ACE spacecraft. We found that an acceleration cessation distance of 0.76 AU is in reasonable agreement with the observations. The new prediction model reduces the average prediction error from 15.4 to 10.7 hours. The model is in good agreement with the observations for high-speed CMEs. For slow CMEs the model as well as observations show a flat arrival time of ∼4.3 days. Use of quadrature observations minimized the projection effects naturally without the need to assume the width of the CMEs. However, there is no simple way of estimating the projection effects based on the surface location of the Earth-directed CMEs observed by a spacecraft (such as SOHO) located along the Sun-Earth line because it is impossible to measure the width of these CMEs. The standard assumption that the CME is a rigid cone may not be correct. In fact, the predicted arrival times have a better agreement with the observed arrival times when no projection correction is applied to the SOHO CME measurements. The results presented in this work suggest that CMEs expand and accelerate near the Sun (inside 0.7 AU) more than our model supposes; these aspects will have to be included in future models.},

About 600 probable ICMEs were identified from the solar wind plasma and magnetic field data from these spacecraft. We use these events to study the radial evolution of ICMEs between 0.3 and 5.4 AU, mainly in a statistical sense. The occurrence rate of ICME approximately follows the solar activity cycle. ICMEs expand as they move outward since the internal pressure is generally larger than the external pressure. The average radial width of ICMEs increases with distance. ICMEs expand by a factor of 2.7 in radial width between 1 and 5 AU. The radial expansion speed of ICMEs decreases with distance and is of the order of the Alfv{\'e}n speed. The density and magnetic field magnitude decrease faster in ICMEs, which fall off with distance R as R−2.4 and R−1.5, respectively, than in the ambient solar wind; however, the temperature decreases as R−0.7, slightly less rapid than in the ambient solar wind. These results are consistent with previous findings with relatively limited data coverage. We also use a one-dimensional MHD model to investigate the radial expansion of the ICMEs and find that the radial expansion speed is of the order of the Alfv{\'e}n speed, consistent with the observations.},

	abstract = {Abstract We present an advance toward accurately predicting the arrivals of coronal mass ejections 
	(CMEs) at the terrestrial planets, including Earth. For the first time, we are able to assess a CME prediction 
	model using data over two thirds of a solar cycle of observations with the Heliophysics System Observatory. We 
	validate modeling results of 1337 CMEs observed with the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) 
	heliospheric imagers (HI) (science data) from 8 years of observations by five in situ observing spacecraft. We use 
	the self‐similar expansion model for CME fronts assuming 60$\,^{\circ}$ longitudinal width, constant speed, and constant 
	propagation direction. With these assumptions we find that 23\%--35\% of all CMEs that were predicted to hit a 
	certain spacecraft lead to clear in situ signatures, so that for one correct prediction, two to three false alarms 
	would have been issued. In addition, we find that the prediction accuracy does not degrade with the HI longitudinal 
	separation from Earth. Predicted arrival times are on average within 2.6 $\pm$ 16.6 h difference of the in situ arrival 
	time, similar to analytical and numerical modeling, and a true skill statistic of 0.21. We also discuss various 
	factors that may improve the accuracy of space weather forecasting using wide‐angle heliospheric imager 
	observations. These results form a first‐order approximated baseline of the prediction accuracy that is possible 
	with HI and other methods used for data by an operational space weather mission at the Sun‐Earth L5 point.},

	of the FDs measured at Mars, by RAD, and at Earth, by NMs, for the same time span. A carefully chosen sample of FDs 
	at Earth and at Mars, driven by the same ICME, led to a significant correlation (cc=0.71{\$}cc=0.71{\$}) and a 
	linear regression between the sizes of the FDs at the different observing points at the respective energies at Mars

@article{Temmer-2012,
	abstract = {We study the interaction of two successive coronal mass ejections (CMEs) during the 2010 August 1 events using STEREO/SECCHI COR and heliospheric imager (HI) data. We obtain the direction of motion for both CMEs by applying several independent reconstruction methods and find that the CMEs head in similar directions. This provides evidence that a full interaction takes place between the two CMEs that can be observed in the HI1 field of view. The full de-projected kinematics of the faster CME from Sun to Earth is derived by combining remote observations with in situ measurements of the CME at 1 AU. The speed profile of the faster CME (CME2; ∼1200 km s--1) shows a strong deceleration over the distance range at which it reaches the slower, preceding CME (CME1; ∼700 km s--1). By applying a drag-based model we are able to reproduce the kinematical profile of CME2, suggesting that CME1 represents a magnetohydrodynamic obstacle for CME2 and that, after the interaction, the merged entity propagates as a single structure in an ambient flow of speed and density typical for quiet solar wind conditions. Observational facts show that magnetic forces may contribute to the enhanced deceleration of CME2. We speculate that the increase in magnetic tension and pressure, when CME2 bends and compresses the magnetic field lines of CME1, increases the efficiency of drag.},

particles in gradual solar events is reproduced in simulations. Based on
a numerical solution of the focused transport equation, we obtain the
intensity time profiles of solar energetic particles (SEPs) accelerated
by an interplanetary shock in three-dimensional interplanetary space.
The shock is treated as a moving source of energetic particles with a
distribution function. The time profiles of particle fluxes with
different energies are calculated in the ecliptic at 1 AU. According to
our model, we find that shock acceleration strength, parallel diffusion,
and adiabatic cooling are the main factors in forming the spatial
invariance in SEP spectra, and perpendicular diffusion is a secondary
factor. In addition, the temporal invariance in SEP spectra is mainly
due to the effects of adiabatic cooling. Furthermore, a spectra
invariant region, which agrees with observations but is different from
the one suggested by Reames et al. is proposed based on our simulations.

events with numerical simulations and analyzes the accuracy of the
velocity dispersion analysis (VDA) method. Using a three-dimensional
focused transport model, we calculate the fluxes of protons observed in
the ecliptic at 1 AU in the energy range between 10 MeV and 80 MeV. In
particular, three models are used to describe different SEP sources
produced by flare or coronal shock, and the effects of particle
perpendicular diffusion in the interplanetary space are also studied. We
have the following findings. When the observer is disconnected from the
source, the effects of perpendicular diffusion in the interplanetary
space and particles propagating in the solar atmosphere have a
significant influence on the VDA results. As a result, although the VDA
method is valid with impulsive source duration, low background, and weak
scattering in the interplanetary space or fast diffusion in the solar
atmosphere, the method is not valid with gradual source duration, high
background, or strong scattering.
