	of solar mass ejections and other heliospheric structures which are moving towards the Earth. Such events may cause 
	geomagnetic storms, with resulting radiation hazards and disruption to military and commercial communications; 
	damage to Earth-orbiting spacecraft; and also terrestrial effects such as surges in transcontinental power 
	transmission lines. The detectors are sensitive over the optical wave-band, which is measured using CCD cameras. 
	SMEI was launched on 6 January 2003 on the Coriolis spacecraft into a Sun-synchronous polar orbit as part of the US 
	DoD Space Test Programme. The instrument contains three cameras, each with a field of view of 
	60{\textdegree}{\texttimes}3{\textdegree}, which are mounted onto the spacecraft such that they scan most of the 
	sky every 102-min orbit. The sensitivity is such that changes in sky brightness equivalent to a tenth magnitude 
	star in one square degree of sky may be detected. Each camera takes an image every 4 s. The normal telemetry rate 
	is 128 kbits s−1. In order to extract the emission from a typical large coronal mass ejection, stellar images and 
	the signal from the zodiacal dust cloud must be subtracted. This requires accurate relative photometry to 0.1{\%}. 
	One consequence is that images of stars and the zodiacal cloud will be measured to this photometric accuracy once 
	per orbit. This will enable studies of transient zodiacal cloud phenomena, flare stars, supernovae, comets, and 
	other varying point-like objects.",

	abstract={Since the advent of wide-angle imaging of the inner heliosphere, a plethora of techniques have been 
	developed to investigate the three-dimensional structure and kinematics of solar wind transients, such as coronal 
	mass ejections, from their signatures in single- and multi-spacecraft imaging observations. These techniques, which 
	range from the highly complex and computationally intensive to methods based on simple curve fitting, all have 
	their inherent advantages and limitations. In the analysis of single-spacecraft imaging observations, much use has 
	been made of the fixed phi fitting (FPF) and harmonic mean 
	fitting (HMF) techniques, in which the solar wind transient is considered to be a radially propagating point source 
	(fixed phi , FP, model) and a radially expanding circle 
	anchored at Sun centre (harmonic mean, HM, model), respectively. Initially, we compare the radial speeds and 
	propagation directions derived from application of the FPF and HMF techniques to a large set of STEREO 
	/Heliospheric Imager (HI) observations. As the geometries on which these two techniques are founded constitute 
	extreme descriptions of solar wind transients in terms of their extent along the line of sight, we describe a 
	single-spacecraft fitting technique based on a more generalized model for which the FP and HM geometries form the 
	limiting cases. In addition to providing estimates of a transient's speed and propagation direction, the 
	self-similar expansion fitting (SSEF) technique provides, in theory, the capability to estimate the transient's 
	angular extent in the plane orthogonal to the field of view. Using the HI observations, and also by performing a 
	Monte Carlo simulation, we assess the potential of the SSEF technique.}

abstract={We reconstruct the global structure and kinematics of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) using coordinated imaging 
and in situ observations from multiple vantage points. A forward modeling technique, which assumes a rope-like 
morphology for CMEs, is used to determine the global structure (including orientation and propagation direction) from 
coronagraph observations. We reconstruct the corresponding structure from in situ measurements at 1 AU with the 
Grad-Shafranov method, which gives the flux-rope orientation, cross section, and a rough knowledge of the propagation 
direction. CME kinematics (propagation direction and radial distance) during the transit from the Sun to 1 AU are 
studied with a geometric triangulation technique, which provides an unambiguous association between solar observations 
and in situ signatures; a track fitting approach is invoked when data are available from only one spacecraft. We show 
how the results obtained from imaging and in situ data can be compared by applying these methods to the 2007 November 
14-16 and 2008 December 12 CMEs. This merged imaging and in situ study shows important consequences and implications 
for CME research as well as space weather forecasting: (1) CME propagation directions can be determined to a relatively 
good precision as shown by the consistency between different methods; (2) the geometric triangulation technique shows a 
promising capability to link solar observations with corresponding in situ signatures at 1 AU and to predict CME 
arrival at the Earth; (3) the flux rope within CMEs, which has the most hazardous southward magnetic field, cannot be 
imaged at large distances due to expansion; (4) the flux-rope orientation derived from in situ measurements at 1 AU may 
have a large deviation from that determined by coronagraph image modeling; and (5) we find, for the first time, that 
CMEs undergo a westward migration with respect to the Sun-Earth line at their acceleration phase, which we suggest is a 
universal feature produced by the magnetic field connecting the Sun and ejecta. The importance of having dedicated 
spacecraft at L4 and L5, which are well situated for the triangulation concept, is also discussed based on the results.}

	abstract={One of the goals of the NASA Solar TErestrial RElations Observatory ( STEREO ) mission is to study the 
	feasibility of forecasting the direction, arrival time, and internal structure of solar coronal mass ejections 
	(CMEs) from a vantage point outside the Sun-Earth line. Through a case study, we discuss the arrival time 
	calculation of interplanetary CMEs (ICMEs) in the ecliptic plane using data from STEREO/SECCHI at large elongations 
	from the Sun in combination with different geometric assumptions about the ICME front shape [fixed-Φ (FP): a point 
	and harmonic mean (HM): a circle]. These forecasting techniques use single-spacecraft imaging data and are based on 
	the assumption of constant velocity and direction. We show that for the slow (350 km s –1 ) ICME on 2009 February 
	13-18, observed at quadrature by the two STEREO spacecraft, the results for the arrival time given by the HM 
	approximation are more accurate by 12 hr than those for FP in comparison to in situ observations of solar wind 
	plasma and magnetic field parameters by STEREO/IMPACT/PLASTIC , and by 6 hr for the arrival time at Venus Express ( 
	MAG ). We propose that the improvement is directly related to the ICME front shape being more accurately described 
	by HM for an ICME with a low inclination of its symmetry axis to the ecliptic. In this case, the ICME has to be 
	tracked to >30° elongation to obtain arrival time errors < ± 5 hr. A newly derived formula for calculating arrival 
	times with the HM method is also useful for a triangulation technique assuming the same geometry.}

	abstract="The NASA Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) mission offered the possibility to forecast the 
	arrival times, speeds, and directions of solar transients from outside the Sun--Earth line. In particular, we are 
	interested in predicting potentially geoeffective interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) from observations 
	of density structures at large observation angles from the Sun (with the STEREO Heliospheric Imager instrument). We 
	contribute to this endeavor by deriving analytical formulas concerning a geometric correction for the ICME speed 
	and arrival time for the technique introduced by Davies et al. (Astrophys. J., 2012, in press), called self-similar 
	expansion fitting (SSEF). This model assumes that a circle propagates outward, along a plane specified by a 
	position angle (e.g., the ecliptic), with constant angular half-width ($\lambda$). This is an extension to earlier, 
	more simple models: fixed-$\Phi$ fitting ($\lambda$=0{\textdegree}) and harmonic mean fitting 
	($\lambda$=90{\textdegree}). In contrast to previous models, this approach has the advantage of allowing one to 
	assess clearly if a particular location in the heliosphere, such as a planet or spacecraft, might be expected to be 
	hit by the ICME front. Our correction formulas are especially significant for glancing hits, where small 
	differences in the direction greatly influence the expected speeds (up to 100{\thinspace}--{\thinspace}200 
	km{\thinspace}s−1) and arrival times (up to two days later than the apex). For very wide ICMEs 
	(2$\lambda$>120{\textdegree}), the geometric correction becomes very similar to the one derived by M{\"o}stl et al. 
	(Astrophys. J.                741, 34, 2011) for the harmonic mean model. These analytic expressions can also be 
	used for empirical or analytical models to predict the 1 AU arrival time of an ICME by correcting for effects of 
	hits by the flank rather than the apex, if the width and direction of the ICME in a plane are known and a circular

	abstract = {Abstract The propagation of 15 interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) from Earth's orbit (1 AU) 
	to Mars (∼1.5 AU) has been studied with their propagation speed estimated from both measurements and simulations. 
	The enhancement of magnetic fields related to ICMEs and their shock fronts causes the so‐called Forbush decrease, 
	which can be detected as a reduction of galactic cosmic rays measured on ground. We have used galactic cosmic ray 
	(GCR) data from in situ measurements at Earth, from both STEREO A and STEREO B as well as GCR measurements by the 
	Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) instrument on board Mars Science Laboratory on the surface of Mars. A set of 
	ICME events has been selected during the periods when Earth (or STEREO A or STEREO B) and Mars locations were 
	nearly aligned on the same side of the Sun in the ecliptic plane (so‐called opposition phase). Such lineups allow 
	us to estimate the ICMEs' transit times between 1 and 1.5 AU by estimating the delay time of the corresponding 
	Forbush decreases measured at each location. We investigate the evolution of their propagation speeds before and 
	after passing Earth's orbit and find that the deceleration of ICMEs due to their interaction with the ambient solar 
	wind may continue beyond 1 AU. We also find a substantial variance of the speed evolution among different events 
	revealing the dynamic and diverse nature of eruptive solar events. Furthermore, the results are compared to 
	simulation data obtained from two CME propagation models, namely the Drag‐Based Model and ENLIL plus cone model.}

	CMEs do not result in even moderate geomagnetic activity. We study the relationship of all the ejecta 
	(interplanetary CMEs) which passed Earth during 1996–1999 to coronagraph CMEs and geomagnetic activity. We reach 
	the following conclusions: (1) Only about half of frontside halo CMEs encounter the Earth; (2) The geoeffectiveness 
	of ejecta depends strongly on the southward magnetic field strength and, for the same southward field, is 
	irrespective of whether or not the ejecta has a magnetic cloud structure; (3) Transit speeds of ejecta to Earth are 
	only loosely correlated with CME speeds, one influence being the prevailing solar wind conditions between the Sun 
	and Earth; (4) Ejecta may be detected at Earth even when there is no preceding halo CME observed by LASCO. Such 
	ejecta are not particularly geoeffective.}

	abstract={In 2012 March the Sun exhibited extraordinary activities. In particular, the active region NOAA AR 11429 
	emitted a series of large coronal mass ejections (CMEs) which were imaged by the Solar Terrestrial Relations 
	Observatory as it rotated with the Sun from the east to west. These sustained eruptions are expected to generate a 
	global shell of disturbed material sweeping through the heliosphere. A cluster of shocks and interplanetary CMEs 
	were observed near the Earth, and are propagated outward from 1 AU using an MHD model. The transient streams 
	interact with each other, which erases memory of the source and results in a large merged interaction region (MIR) 
	with a preceding shock. The MHD model predicts that the shock and MIR would reach 120 AU around 2013 April 22, 
	which agrees well with the period of radio emissions and the time of a transient disturbance in galactic cosmic 
	rays detected by Voyager 1 . These results are important for understanding the "fate" of CMEs in the outer 
	heliosphere and provide confidence that the heliopause is located around 120 AU from the Sun.}

	phenomena such as coronal mass ejections, interplanetary shocks, and solar wind fine structure, with advanced, 3-D

	multi-spacecraft studies where they can be used in conjunction with other, simultaneous observations from 
	spacecraft such as Ulysses. The SWEPAM observations are made simultaneously with independent electron and ion 
	instruments. In order to save costs for the ACE project, we recycled the flight spares from the joint NASA/ESA 
	Ulysses mission. Both instruments have undergone selective refurbishment as well as modernization and modifications 
	required to meet the ACE mission and spacecraft accommodation requirements. Both incorporate electrostatic 
	analyzers whose fan-shaped fields of view sweep out all pertinent look directions as the spacecraft spins. 
	Enhancements in the SWEPAM instruments from their original forms as Ulysses spare instruments include (1) a factor 
	of 16 increase in the accumulation interval (and hence sensitivity) for high energy, halo electrons; (2) halving of 
	the effective ion-detecting CEM spacing from ∼5{\textdegree} on Ulysses to ∼2.5{\textdegree} for ACE; and (3) the 
	inclusion of a 20{\textdegree} conical swath of enhanced sensitivity coverage in order to measure suprathermal ions 
	outside of the solar wind beam. New control electronics and programming provide for 64-s resolution of the full

	observations, to track coronal mass ejections (CMEs) continuously in the heliosphere and predict their impact on 
	the Earth. Taking advantage of stereoscopic imaging observations from the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, 
	this technique can determine the propagation direction and radial distance of CMEs from their birth in the corona 
	all the way to 1 AU. The efficacy of the method is demonstrated by its application to the 2008 December 12 CME, 
	which manifests as a magnetic cloud (MC) from in situ measurements at the Earth. The predicted arrival time and 
	radial velocity at the Earth are well confirmed by the in situ observations around the MC. Our method reveals 
	non-radial motions and velocity changes of the CME over large distances in the heliosphere. It also associates the 
	flux-rope structure measured in situ with the dark cavity of the CME in imaging observations. Implementation of the 
	technique, which is expected to be a routine possibility in the future, may indicate a substantial advance in CME 
	studies as well as space weather forecasting.}

	structures, stream interaction regions (SIRs), and interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs), near 5.3 AU, 
	using solar-wind observations from Ulysses. Our study is confined to the three aphelion passes of Ulysses, and also 
	within {\textpm}{\thinspace}10{\textdegree} of the solar ecliptic plane, covering a part of 1992, 
	1997{\thinspace}--{\thinspace}1998, and 2003{\thinspace}--{\thinspace}2005, representing three slices of different 
	phases of the solar activity cycle. Overall, there are 54 SIRs and 60 ICMEs in the survey. Many are merged in 
	hybrid events, suggesting that they have undergone multiple interactions prior to reaching Jovian orbit. About 
	91{\%} of SIRs occur with shocks, with 47{\%} of such shocks being forward{\thinspace}--{\thinspace}reverse shock 
	pairs. The solar-wind velocity sometimes stays constant or even decreases within the interaction region near 5.3 
	AU, in contrast with the gradual velocity increase during SIRs at 1 AU. Shocks are driven by 58{\%} of ICMEs, with 
	94{\%} of them being forward shocks. Some ICMEs seem to have multiple small flux ropes with different scales and 
	properties. We quantitatively compare various properties of SIRs and ICMEs at 5.3 AU, and study their statistical 
	distributions and variations with solar activity. The width, maximum dynamic pressure, and peak perpendicular 
	pressure of SIRs all become larger than ICMEs. Dynamic pressure (P                        dyn) is expected to be 
	important for Jovian magnetospheric activity. We have examined the distributions of P                        dyn of 
	SIRs, ICMEs, and general solar wind, but these cannot explain the observed bimodal distribution of the location of 
	the Jovian magnetopause. By comparing the properties of SIRs and ICMEs at 0.72, 1, and 5.3 AU, we find that the

	abstract={Forecasting the in situ properties of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from 
	remote images is expected to 
	strongly enhance predictions of space weather and is of general interest for studying 
	the interaction of CMEs with 
	planetary environments. We study the feasibility of using a single heliospheric imager 
	(HI) instrument, imaging the 
	solar wind density from the Sun to 1 AU, for connecting remote images to in situ 
	observations of CMEs. We compare 
	the predictions of speed and arrival time for 22 CMEs (in 2008-2012) to the 
	corresponding interplanetary coronal 
	mass ejection (ICME) parameters at in situ observatories ( STEREO PLASTIC/IMPACT, Wind 
	SWE/MFI). The list consists 
	of front- and backsided, slow and fast CMEs (up to 2700 km s –1 ). We track the CMEs to 
	34.9 ± 7.1 deg elongation 
	from the Sun with J maps constructed using the SATPLOT tool, resulting in prediction 
	lead times of –26.4 ± 15.3 hr. 
	The geometrical models we use assume different CME front shapes (fixed-Φ, harmonic mean, 
	self-similar expansion) 
	and constant CME speed and direction. We find no significant superiority in the 
	predictive capability of any of the 
	three methods. The absolute difference between predicted and observed ICME arrival times 
	is 8.1 ± 6.3 hr (rms value 
	of 10.9 hr). Speeds are consistent to within 284 ± 288 km s –1 . Empirical corrections 
	to the predictions enhance 
	their performance for the arrival times to 6.1 ± 5.0 hr (rms value of 7.9 hr), and for 
	the speeds to 53 ± 50 km s 
	–1 . These results are important for Solar Orbiter and a space weather mission 
	positioned away from the Sun-Earth

	abstract={In 2010 May 23-24, Solar Dynamics Observatory ( SDO) observed the launch of 
	two successive coronal mass 
	ejections (CMEs), which were subsequently tracked by the SECCHI suite on board STEREO . 
	Using the COR2 coronagraphs 
	and the heliospheric imagers (HIs), the initial direction of both CMEs is determined to 
	be slightly west of the 
	Sun-Earth line. We derive the CME kinematics, including the evolution of the CME 
	expansion until 0.4 AU. We find 
	that, during the interaction, the second CME decelerates from a speed above 500 km s –1 
	to 380 km s –1 , the speed 
	of the leading edge of the first CME. STEREO observes a complex structure composed of 
	two different bright tracks 
	in HI2-A but only one bright track in HI2-B. In situ measurements from Wind show an 
	"isolated" interplanetary CME, 
	with the geometry of a flux rope preceded by a shock. Measurements in the sheath are 
	consistent with draping around 
	the transient. By combining remote-sensing and in situ measurements, we determine that 
	this event shows a clear 
	instance of deflection of two CMEs after their collision, and we estimate the deflection 
	of the first CME to be 
	about 10° toward the Sun-Earth line. The arrival time, arrival speed, and radius at 
	Earth of the first CME are best 
	predicted from remote-sensing observations taken before the collision of the CMEs. Due 
	to the over-expansion of the 
	CME after the collision, there are few, if any, signs of interaction in in situ 
	measurements. This study 
	illustrates that complex interactions during the Sun-to-Earth propagation may not be 
	revealed by in situ 
	measurements alone.}

	on the ICME propagation in interplanetary (IP) space that is governed by two forces: the propelling Lorentz force 
	and the drag force. We address the question: which heliospheric distance range does the drag become dominant and 
	the CME adjust to the solar wind flow. To this end, we analyze speed differences between ICMEs and the ambient 
	solar wind flow as a function of distance. The evolution of the ambient solar wind flow is derived from ENLIL 
	three-dimensional MHD model runs using different solar wind models, namely, Wang-Sheeley-Arge and 
	MHD-Around-A-Sphere. Comparing the measured CME kinematics with the solar wind models, we find that the CME speed 
	becomes adjusted to the solar wind speed at very different heliospheric distances in the three events under study: 
	from below 30 R ☉ , to beyond 1 AU, depending on the CME and ambient solar wind characteristics. ENLIL can be used 
	to derive important information about the overall structure of the background solar wind, providing more reliable 
	results during times of low solar activity than during times of high solar activity. The results from this study 
	enable us to obtain greater insight into the forces acting on CMEs over the IP space distance range, which is an

	abstract = {Abstract Extreme space weather due to coronal mass ejections has the potential to cause considerable 
	disruption to the global economy by damaging the transformers required to operate electricity transmission 
	infrastructure. However, expert opinion is split between the potential outcome being one of a temporary regional 
	blackout and of a more prolonged event. The temporary blackout scenario proposed by some is expected to last the 
	length of the disturbance, with normal operations resuming after a couple of days. On the other hand, others have 
	predicted widespread equipment damage with blackout scenarios lasting months. In this paper we explore the 
	potential costs associated with failure in the electricity transmission infrastructure in the U.S. due to extreme 
	space weather, focusing on daily economic loss. This provides insight into the direct and indirect economic 
	consequences of how an extreme space weather event may affect domestic production, as well as other nations, via 
	supply chain linkages. By exploring the sensitivity of the blackout zone, we show that on average the direct 
	economic cost incurred from disruption to electricity represents only 49\% of the total potential macroeconomic 
	cost. Therefore, if indirect supply chain costs are not considered when undertaking cost‐benefit analysis of space 
	weather forecasting and mitigation investment, the total potential macroeconomic cost is not correctly represented. 
	The paper contributes to our understanding of the economic impact of space weather, as well as making a number of 
	key methodological contributions relevant for future work. Further economic impact assessment of this threat must 
	consider multiday, multiregional events.}

	(CMEs) at the terrestrial planets, including Earth. For the first time, we are able to assess a CME prediction 
	model using data over two thirds of a solar cycle of observations with the Heliophysics System Observatory. We 
	validate modeling results of 1337 CMEs observed with the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) 
	heliospheric imagers (HI) (science data) from 8 years of observations by five in situ observing spacecraft. We use 
	the self‐similar expansion model for CME fronts assuming 60° longitudinal width, constant speed, and constant 
	propagation direction. With these assumptions we find that 23\%–35\% of all CMEs that were predicted to hit a 
	certain spacecraft lead to clear in situ signatures, so that for one correct prediction, two to three false alarms 
	would have been issued. In addition, we find that the prediction accuracy does not degrade with the HI longitudinal 
	separation from Earth. Predicted arrival times are on average within 2.6 ± 16.6 h difference of the in situ arrival 
	time, similar to analytical and numerical modeling, and a true skill statistic of 0.21. We also discuss various 
	factors that may improve the accuracy of space weather forecasting using wide‐angle heliospheric imager 
	observations. These results form a first‐order approximated baseline of the prediction accuracy that is possible 
	with HI and other methods used for data by an operational space weather mission at the Sun‐Earth L5 point.}

    abstract={We present a forward-modeling technique for flux rope-like CMEs using an empirically defined model of a

    assume an electron distribution through the GCS and derive synthetic images in total and polarized brightness for 
    various projections of the model using a Thomson scattering ray-tracing program. We test our forward modeling 
    technique on 34 LASCO CMEs analyzed by Cremades & Bothmer. We are able to reproduce the CME morphology and derive 
    the electron density (at the CME front) of these events using multi-instrument observations (MDI, Hα, EIT, LASCO) 
    under the assumption of self-similar expansion. This study suggests that a flux rope-like structure is a good 
    description for these events. We also find that we need to invoke a deflection and/or rotation of the structure 
    relative to the position and orientation of the source region in most cases. Finally, we demonstrate an original 
    technique to fit the electron density of the CME leading edge. We find that, on average, the peak of the density at 
    the CME front is 7.5 times that in the equatorial model of Saito et al., and can reach ~22 times the model in some

    abstract={The graduated cylindrical shell (GCS) model developed by Thernisien et al. has been used with the goal of 
    studying the three-dimensional morphology, position, and kinematics of coronal mass ejections observed by 
    coronagraphs. These studies focused more on the results rather than the details of the model itself. As more 
    researchers begin to use the model, it becomes necessary to provide a deeper discussion on how it is derived, which 
    is the purpose of this paper. The model is built using the following features and constraints: (1) the legs are 
    conical, (2) the front is pseudo-circular, (3) the cross section is circular, and (4) it expands in a self-similar 
    way. We derive the equation of the model from these constraints. We also show that the ice-cream cone model is a 
    limit of the GCS when the two legs overlap completely. Finally, we provide formulae for the calculation of various 
    geometrical dimensions, such as angular width and aspect ratio, as well as the pseudo-code that is used for its

	particles by perpendicular diffusion. The model is restricted to explaining only the depression caused by the 
	magnetic structure of the interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME). We use remote CME observations and a 3D 
	reconstruction method (the graduated cylindrical shell method) to constrain initial boundary conditions of the FD 
	model and take into account CME evolutionary properties by incorporating flux rope expansion. Several flux rope 
	expansion modes are considered, which can lead to different FD characteristics. In general, the model is 
	qualitatively in agreement with observations, whereas quantitative agreement depends on the diffusion coefficient 
	and the expansion properties (interplay of the diffusion and expansion). A case study was performed to explain the 
	FD observed on 2014 May 30. The observed FD was fitted quite well by ForbMod for all expansion modes using only the 
	diffusion coefficient as a free parameter, where the diffusion parameter was found to correspond to an expected 
	range of values. Our study shows that, in general, the model is able to explain the global properties of an FD

    evidence that there was liquid water on the planet in the distant past. Whether any liquid water remains on Mars 
    today has long been debated. Orosei et al. used radar measurements from the Mars Express spacecraft to search for 
    liquid water in Mars{\textquoteright} southern ice cap (see the Perspective by Diez). They detected a 20-km-wide 
    lake of liquid water underneath solid ice in the Planum Australe region. The water is probably kept from freezing

    astrobiology and future human exploration.Science, this issue p. 490; see also p. 448The presence of liquid water

    radar on the Mars Express spacecraft. Radar profiles collected between May 2012 and December 2015 contain evidence

    reflections are evident within a well-defined, 20-kilometer-wide zone centered at 193{\textdegree}E, 
    81{\textdegree}S, which is surrounded by much less reflective areas. Quantitative analysis of the radar signals 
    shows that this bright feature has high relative dielectric permittivity (\&gt;15), matching that of water-bearing

    abstract="Solar Probe Plus (SPP) will be the first spacecraft to fly into the low solar corona. SPP's main science 
    goal is to determine the structure and dynamics of the Sun's coronal magnetic field, understand how the solar 
    corona and wind are heated and accelerated, and determine what processes accelerate energetic particles. 
    Understanding these fundamental phenomena has been a top-priority science goal for over five decades, dating back 
    to the 1958 Simpson Committee Report. The scale and concept of such a mission has been revised at intervals since 
    that time, yet the core has always been a close encounter with the Sun. The mission design and the technology and 
    engineering developments enable SPP to meet its science objectives to: (1) Trace the flow of energy that heats and 
    accelerates the solar corona and solar wind; (2) Determine the structure and dynamics of the plasma and magnetic 
    fields at the sources of the solar wind; and (3) Explore mechanisms that accelerate and transport energetic 
    particles. The SPP mission was confirmed in March 2014 and is under development as a part of NASA's Living with a 
    Star (LWS) Program. SPP is scheduled for launch in mid-2018, and will perform 24 orbits over a 7-year nominal 
    mission duration. Seven Venus gravity assists gradually reduce SPP's perihelion from 35 solar radii

    abstract="The Wide-field Imager for Solar PRobe Plus (WISPR) is the sole imager aboard the Solar Probe Plus (SPP) 
    mission scheduled for launch in 2018. SPP will be a unique mission designed to orbit as close as 7 million km (9.86 
    solar radii) from Sun center. WISPR employs a 95∘ radial by 58∘ transverse field of view to image the fine-scale 
    structure of the solar corona, derive the 3D structure of the large-scale corona, and determine whether a dust-free 
    zone exists near the Sun. WISPR is the smallest heliospheric imager to date yet it comprises two nested wide-field 
    telescopes with large-format (2 K {\texttimes} 2 K) APS CMOS detectors to optimize the performance for their 
    respective fields of view and to minimize the risk of dust damage, which may be considerable close to the Sun. The 
    WISPR electronics are very flexible allowing the collection of individual images at cadences up to 1 second at 
    perihelion or the summing of multiple images to increase the signal-to-noise when the spacecraft is further from 
    the Sun. The dependency of the Thomson scattering emission of the corona on the imaging geometry dictates that 
    WISPR will be very sensitive to the emission from plasma close to the spacecraft in contrast to the situation for 
    imaging from Earth orbit. WISPR will be the first `local' imager providing a crucial link between the large-scale 
    corona and the in-situ measurements.",
