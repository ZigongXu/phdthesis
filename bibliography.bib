	abstract = {The propagation of 15 interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) from Earth's orbit (1 AU) to Mars (∼1.5 AU) has been studied with their propagation speed estimated from both measurements and simulations. The enhancement of magnetic fields related to ICMEs and their shock fronts causes the so-called Forbush decrease, which can be detected as a reduction of galactic cosmic rays measured on ground. We have used galactic cosmic ray (GCR) data from in situ measurements at Earth, from both STEREO A and STEREO B as well as GCR measurements by the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) instrument on board Mars Science Laboratory on the surface of Mars. A set of ICME events has been selected during the periods when Earth (or STEREO A or STEREO B) and Mars locations were nearly aligned on the same side of the Sun in the ecliptic plane (so-called opposition phase). Such lineups allow us to estimate the ICMEs' transit times between 1 and 1.5 AU by estimating the delay time of the corresponding Forbush decreases measured at each location. We investigate the evolution of their propagation speeds before and after passing Earth's orbit and find that the deceleration of ICMEs due to their interaction with the ambient solar wind may continue beyond 1 AU. We also find a substantial variance of the speed evolution among different events revealing the dynamic and diverse nature of eruptive solar events. Furthermore, the results are compared to simulation data obtained from two CME propagation models, namely the Drag-Based Model and ENLIL plus cone model.},

	large data set collected by HI makes it possible to analyze 149 ICMEs propagating toward MSL both during its 
	8-month cruise phase and after its landing on Mars. We link 45 of the events observed at STEREO-HI to their 
	corresponding FDs at MSL/RAD and study the accuracy of the ICME arrival time at Mars predicted from HI data using 
	different methods. The mean differences between the predicted arrival times and those observed using FDs range from 
	−11–5 hr for the different methods, with standard deviations between 17 and 20 hr. These values for predictions at

	abstract = {Forbush decreases (FDs), which are short-term drops in the flux of galactic cosmic rays (GCR), are caused by the shielding from strong and/or turbulent magnetic structures in the solar wind, especially interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) and their associated shocks, as well as corotating interaction regions (CIRs). Such events can be observed at Earth, e.g. using neutron monitors, but also at many other locations in the solar system, such as on the surface of Mars with the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) instrument onboard Mars Science Laboratory (MSL). They are often used as a proxy for detecting the arrival of ICMEs or CIRs, especially when sufficient in situ solar wind measurements are not available. We compare the properties of FDs observed at Earth and Mars, focusing on events produced by ICMEs. We find that FDs at both locations show a correlation between their total amplitude and the maximum hourly decrease, but with different proportionality factors. We explain this difference using theoretical modelling approaches and suggest that it is related to the size increase of ICMEs, and in particular their sheath regions, en route from Earth to Mars. From the FD data, we can derive the sheath broadening factor to be between about 1.5 and 1.9, agreeing with our theoretical considerations. This factor is also in line with previous measurements of the sheath evolution closer to the Sun.},

As the solar particle event flux was gradually declining, a shock front reached Mars and caused a sudden drop of about 15\% in instantaneous dose rates. No solar particles followed the shock arrival, and the magnetic shielding of galactic cosmic rays by the shock reduced their intensity to levels below those seen before the start of the event.

@article{Guo-2018,
	abstract = {On 10 September 2017, solar energetic particles originating from the active region 12673 produced a ground level enhancement at Earth. The ground level enhancement on the surface of Mars, 160 longitudinally east of Earth, observed by the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) was the largest since the landing of the Curiosity rover in August 2012. Based on multipoint coronagraph images and the Graduated Cylindrical Shell model, we identify the initial 3-D kinematics of an extremely fast coronal mass ejection (CME) and its shock front, as well as another two CMEs launched hours earlier with moderate speeds. The three CMEs interacted as they propagated outward into the heliosphere and merged into a complex interplanetary CME (ICME). The arrival of the shock and ICME at Mars caused a very significant Forbush decrease seen by RAD only a few hours later than that at Earth, which was about 0.5 AU closer to the Sun. We investigate the propagation of the three CMEs and the merged ICME together with the shock, using the drag-based model and the WSA-ENLIL plus cone model constrained by the in situ observations. The synergistic study of the ICME and solar energetic particle arrivals at Earth and Mars suggests that to better predict potentially hazardous space weather impacts at Earth and other heliospheric locations for human exploration missions, it is essential to analyze (1) the eruption of the flare and CME at the Sun, (2) the CME kinematics, especially during their interactions, and (3) the spatially and temporally varying heliospheric conditions, such as the evolution and propagation of the stream interaction regions.},

Simultaneously, Hurricanes Irma and Jose caused significant damage to the Caribbean Islands and parts of Florida. The coincidental timing of both the space weather activity and hurricanes was unfortunate, as HF radio was needed for emergency communications. This paper presents the response of HF amateur radio propagation as observed by the Reverse Beacon Network and the Weak Signal Propagation Reporting Network to the space weather events of that period. Distributed data coverage from these dense sources provided a unique mix of global and regional coverage of ionospheric response and recovery that revealed several features of storm time HF propagation dynamics. X-class flares on 6, 7, and 10 September caused acute radio blackouts during the day in the Caribbean with recovery times of tens of minutes to hours, based on the decay time of the flare. A severe geomagnetic storm with Kpmax = 8+ and SYM-Hmin = −146 nT occurring 7–10 September wiped out ionospheric communications first on 14 MHz and then on 7 MHz starting at ∼1200 UT 8 September. This storm, combined with affects from additional flare and geomagnetic activity, contributed to a significant suppression of effective HF propagation bands both globally and in the Caribbean for a period of 12 to 15 days.},

Strong polar cap absorption caused near-total loss of radar backscatter, which prevented the primary SuperDARN data products from being determined for a period of several days. During this interval, the high-latitude and polar cap radars measured unusually low levels of background atmospheric radio noise. We demonstrate that these background noise measurements can be used to observe the spatial and temporal evolution of the polar cap absorption region, using an approach similar to riometry. We find that the temporal evolution of the SuperDARN radar-derived HF attenuation closely follows that of the cosmic noise absorption measured by a riometer. Attenuation of the atmospheric noise up to 10 dB at 12 MHz is measured within the northern polar cap, and up to 14 dB in the southern polar cap, which is consistent with the observed backscatter loss. Additionally, periods of enhanced attenuation lasting 2–4 hr are detected by the midlatitude radars in response to M- and X-class solar flares. Our results demonstrate that SuperDARN's routine measurements of atmospheric radio noise can be used to monitor 8- to 20-MHz radio attenuation from middle to polar latitudes, which may be used to supplement riometer data and also to investigate the causes of SuperDARN backscatter loss during space weather events.},

The flare itself was the highlight of a quite interesting phase of solar-terrestrial interactions caused by the active region known as the Catania sunspot group 46 or active region number 2673 on the NOAA catalog. From 3 to 13 September 2017 strong flare activities occurred, accompanied by a number of radio bursts and earthward-directed coronal mass ejections. Solar wind influences at Earth were modest during the flare activity and limited to the polar regions (Linty et al., 2018, 10.1029/2018SW001940). But, the strong X9.3 flare itself had impacts on the dayside ionosphere causing some problems in navigation services as we present within this paper. The event data observed and analyzed give us the opportunity to improve our understanding of strong and extreme space weather events and allow us to distinguish between the influence of the different event classes on our technological infrastructure within periods of strong solar activity. Here we will discuss our observations with special focus on the X9.3 flare event and provide examples how the flare itself influenced services in the domains of aviation and maritime navigation in the European sector.},

The solar radio noise reduced the signal-to-noise ratio with clear frequency dependence. The impact of the radio burst has been found at L2 and L5 frequencies, but not at L1 frequency. The ground observation of the solar radio spectrum between 1.0 and 2.0 GHz corresponds well to such frequency dependence. The maximum signal-to-noise ratio reduction of -10 dB was found when the solar radio flux was pulsating around 2,000 solar flux unit level. Precise point positioning results show that accuracy is reduced with stronger deviation for dual-frequency solutions than for single-frequency solutions based on L1 signal only. The positioning error refers rather to the solar extreme ultraviolet flare than to solar radio interferences. The results presented here are a clear indication of frequency-dependent GNSS performance degradation during strong space weather events.},

	widely used approach of an initially empty, closed magnetic structure (i.e., flux rope) that fills up slowly with 
	particles by perpendicular diffusion. The model is restricted to explaining only the depression caused by the 
	magnetic structure of the interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME). We use remote CME observations and a 3D 
	reconstruction method (the graduated cylindrical shell method) to constrain initial boundary conditions of the FD 
	model and take into account CME evolutionary properties by incorporating flux rope expansion. Several flux rope 
	expansion modes are considered, which can lead to different FD characteristics. In general, the model is 
	qualitatively in agreement with observations, whereas quantitative agreement depends on the diffusion coefficient 
	and the expansion properties (interplay of the diffusion and expansion). A case study was performed to explain the 
	FD observed on 2014 May 30. The observed FD was fitted quite well by ForbMod for all expansion modes using only the 
	diffusion coefficient as a free parameter, where the diffusion parameter was found to correspond to an expected 
	range of values. Our study shows that, in general, the model is able to explain the global properties of an FD 
	caused by a flux rope and can thus be used to help understand the underlying physics in case studies.}

Combined proton energy spectra are studied based on the LND, SOHO/EPHIN, and ACE/EPAM measurements, which show that LND could provide a complementary data set from a special location on the Moon, contributing to our existing observations and understanding of space environment. We applied velocity dispersion analysis to the impulsive electron event and weak proton enhancement and show that electrons are released only 22 minutes after the flare onset and ∼15 minutes after the type II radio burst, while protons are released more than one hour after the electron release. The beam-like in situ electrons and clear velocity dispersion indicate a good magnetic connection between the source and Earth. This is remarkable because stereoscopic remote-sensing observations from Earth and STEREO-A suggest that the SEPs are associated with an active region nearly 113° away from the magnetic footpoint of Earth. This suggests that these SEPs did not propagate along the nominal Parker spiral normally assumed for ballistic mapping and that the release and propagation mechanism of electrons and protons are likely to differ significantly for this event.},

	year = 	{2020},
	keywords = 	{Solar Orbiter; High Energy Telescope; HET},
	abstract = 	{The Solar Orbiter spacecraft of the European Space Agency ESA was successfully launched on the 10th of February 2020 from Cape Canaveral, USA. During the seven-year nominal mission phase, it will travel as close as 0.27 astronomical units to the Sun to study it from up-close. Solar Orbiter will help to address open scientific questions concerning the physical processes on the surface and within the Sun. For this purpose, the spacecraft is equipped with several scientific instruments, divided into remote sensing and in-situ instrumentation. One of these instruments is the Energetic-Particle-Detector (EPD), consisting of four individual telescopes: the Suprathermal Electron and Proton - telescope (STEP), the Electron and Proton Telescope (EPT), the Suprathermal Ion Spectrograph (SIS), and the High Energy Telescope (HET). HET measures electrons with energies between 0.45 up to 18 MeV, protons with energies between 7 to 105 MeV and heavy ions in the range of 7 to several hundred MeV/nuc. It also identifies individual particle and ion species and achieves a separation for 3He and 4He isotopes of up to a 1{\%} ratio. With that, HET measures the energy-dependent particle composition of solar energetic particle events in the given energy ranges and provides insight into their acceleration and propagation processes. 
	In this work, the onboard data processing of HET is developed. It defines the available scientific data for the characterization of the measured particle environment. 
	As part of the pre-development studies, the influence of the instrument's temperature on the measurement of heavy ions with HET's scintillation crystal is investigated. The analysis has shown, that the non-linearity in light output, called ionization quenching, is independent of temperature in case of the scintillation material used in HET. Ionization quenching originates from high ionization densities in the scintillation material when detecting heavy ions. The results are published in form of a peer-reviewed paper in Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section B: Beam Interactions with Materials and Atoms", Volume 451 (2019). Based on these results, existing ionization quenching prediction models can be used for the development of the onboard data processing. 
	Due to the limited available telemetry bandwidth of Solar Orbiter, it is necessary to categorize and evaluate measured data prior to transmission to Earth. Since this is a sophisticated compression process, a detailed description of the onboard data processing, developed in the scope of this thesis, is provided. The performed simulations, describing the interaction of energetic charged particles with HET, which are essential for the development of HET's onboard data processing are presented in detail. Based on the simulation data, the onboard data processing of HET is developed. The resulting procedures analyze measured particles and assign them to pre-defined histograms based on the particle's energy and species. Based on these histograms, data products are defined, which provide selected parts of these histograms in pre-defined cadences. The necessary conversion factors for inferring the measured particle environment based on the defined data products are calculated and provided as part of this thesis. 
	According to the developed data products and their calculated conversion factors, the capabilities of HET for the detection of solar energetic particle events are investigated and presented using simulations of the expected spectral properties
	and particle compositions, as well as using measurements of instruments of previous missions. 
	The onboard data processing of HET and the defined data products are validated, based on experiments at a heavy ion acceleration facility and the first mission data. From the first data measured by HET during the mission in a real isotropic particle environment, it can be concluded, that HET delivers the expected data and performs as expected in most aspects. Based on this data, optimizations of the onboard data processing are developed in the scope of this thesis and are installed on the HET instrument. 
	In addition to the primary scientific results, e.g. the temperature independence of ionization quenching, this work provides a complete documentation of HET, containing essential information for scientists to understand and correctly interpret the data measured by HET and to develop further optimizations of the onboard data processing if necessary .},

	abstract = 	{Mars as a future target of manned exploration is a place of particular interest in the solar system. Both the past and the present habitability of Mars, and the safety of astronauts working on the Martian surface, depend, among other factors, on the ionizing radiation present on its surface.
	
	As part of the Mars Science Laboratory mission, the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD). One of the scientific goals being addressed by the instrument is to aid in the validation of particle transport models used to simulate the radiation environment on the Martian surface. This thesis aims to address this goal in particular.
	
	Global dust storms are a meteorological feature that is unique to Mars. These storms produce a striking difference in the appearance of the planet, obscuring almost all of its surface beneath a dense layer of dust. In order to predict the changes in radiation environment, simulations comparing a global dust storm to normal atmospheric conditions are performed. Additionally, an attempt is made to validate the results of the simulations using a period of enhanced dust activity that is included in the RAD measurement time.
	
	The Martian radiation environment is dominated by downward particle fluxes of Galactic Cosmic Rays and the secondary particles produced by them. Near the Martian surface, an upward-directed component composed of secondary particles produced in the Martian soil adds to the total radiation environment. In order to fully characterize the radiation environment, this upward component must be understood as well. A method for discriminating particle directionality in RAD for charged particles is developed through simulations and validated through instrument observations. The RAD instrument is unable to determine directionality for neutrons due to its design. However, since neutrons are important for dosimetry, an instrument design capable of measuring neutron directionality is described and its basic capabilities assessed.},

	abstract = {The Mars Science Laboratory rover Curiosity, operating on the surface of Mars, is exposed to radiation fluxes from above and below. Galactic Cosmic Rays travel through the Martian atmosphere, producing a modified spectrum consisting of both primary and secondary particles at ground level. These particles produce an upward directed secondary particle spectrum as they interact with the Martian soil. Here we develop a method to distinguish the upward and downward directed particle fluxes in the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) instrument, verify it using data taken during the cruise to Mars, and apply it to data taken on the Martian surface. We use a combination of Geant4 and Planetocosmics modeling to find discrimination criteria for the flux directions. After developing models of the cruise phase and surface shielding conditions, we compare model-predicted values for the ratio of upward to downward flux with those found in RAD observation data. Given the quality of available information on Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft and rover composition, we find generally reasonable agreement between our models and RAD observation data. This demonstrates the feasibility of the method developed and tested here. We additionally note that the method can also be used to extend the measurement range and capabilities of the RAD instrument to higher energies.},

We compare the scintillator output with the energy loss according to GEANT4 simulations and determine the quenching parameters for each ion species. BGO and BSO share the same crystalline structure but differ in one single component, therefore we also analyse differences in light output and non-linearity between the two scintillators caused by this similarity and present a model predicting these effects for heavy ions."

    flux rope, the graduated cylindrical shell (GCS). To compare it with white-light coronagraph observations, we 
    assume an electron distribution through the GCS and derive synthetic images in total and polarized brightness for 
    various projections of the model using a Thomson scattering ray-tracing program. We test our forward modeling 
    technique on 34 LASCO CMEs analyzed by Cremades & Bothmer. We are able to reproduce the CME morphology and derive 
    the electron density (at the CME front) of these events using multi-instrument observations (MDI, Hα, EIT, LASCO) 
    under the assumption of self-similar expansion. This study suggests that a flux rope-like structure is a good 
    description for these events. We also find that we need to invoke a deflection and/or rotation of the structure 
    relative to the position and orientation of the source region in most cases. Finally, we demonstrate an original 
    technique to fit the electron density of the CME leading edge. We find that, on average, the peak of the density at 
    the CME front is 7.5 times that in the equatorial model of Saito et al., and can reach ~22 times the model in some 
    cases.}

    studying the three-dimensional morphology, position, and kinematics of coronal mass ejections observed by

    researchers begin to use the model, it becomes necessary to provide a deeper discussion on how it is derived, which 
    is the purpose of this paper. The model is built using the following features and constraints: (1) the legs are 
    conical, (2) the front is pseudo-circular, (3) the cross section is circular, and (4) it expands in a self-similar 
    way. We derive the equation of the model from these constraints. We also show that the ice-cream cone model is a 
    limit of the GCS when the two legs overlap completely. Finally, we provide formulae for the calculation of various

However, community standards for peer review of codes and analysis have lagged behind these developments. This absence has contributed to the reproducibility crisis, where inadequate analysis descriptions and loss of scientific data have made scientific studies difficult or impossible to replicate. The heliophysics community has responded to this challenge by expressing a desire for a more open, collaborative set of analysis tools. This article summarizes the current state of these efforts and presents an overview of many of the existing Python heliophysics tools. It also outlines the challenges facing community members who are working toward the goal of an open, collaborative, Python heliophysics toolkit and presents guidelines that can ease the transition from individualistic data analysis practices to an accountable, communalistic environment.},

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {Solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are closely coupled through magnetic reconnection. CMEs are usually accelerated impulsively within the low solar corona, synchronized with the impulsive flare energy release. We investigate the dynamic evolution of a fast CME and its associated X2.8 flare occurring on 2013 May 13. The CME experiences two distinct phases of enhanced acceleration, an impulsive one with a peak value of ∼5  km s−2, followed by an extended phase with accelerations up to 0.7  km s−2. The two-phase CME dynamics is associated with a two-episode flare energy release. While the first episode is consistent with the “standard” eruption of a magnetic flux rope, the second episode of flare energy release is initiated by the reconnection of a large-scale loop in the aftermath of the eruption and produces stronger nonthermal emission up to γ-rays. In addition, this long-duration flare reveals clear signs of ongoing magnetic reconnection during the decay phase, evidenced by extended hard X-ray bursts with energies up to 100–300 keV and intermittent downflows of reconnected loops for >4 hr. The observations reveal that the two-step flare reconnection substantially contributes to the two-phase CME acceleration, and the impulsive CME acceleration precedes the most intense flare energy release. The implications of this non-standard flare/CME observation are discussed.}

	abstract = {Occurrences of solar wind plasma with abnormally low proton temperatures (Tp) have long been associated with the interplanetary manifestations (which we term “ejecta”) of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). We survey the National Space Science Data Center Omni solar wind database for 1965–1991, and data from the Helios 1 and 2 spacecraft for more limited periods, to identify plasma in which Tp is less than the temperature expected (Tex) from the well-established correlation between the solar wind speed and Tp for normal solar wind expansion. The occurrence rate of low-temperature plasma (specifically with Tp/Tex ≤ 0.5) is shown to be correlated with solar activity levels. Individual low-temperature regions have durations from 1 to ∼80 hours with a mean of ∼10 hours. Around one third are encounters with the heliospheric plasma sheet (HPS). These events are observed most frequently during the increasing phase of solar activity when the HPS lies closer to the ecliptic. The abnormally low temperatures may be intrinsic to the HPS or may provide support for the proposal that the coronal streamer belt underlying the HPS is a frequent source of ejecta. The remaining events have an occurrence rate which shows a particularly clear correlation with solar activity levels and with the CME rate at the Sun (when CME observations are available), consistent with an association with ejecta. These events also show greater than chance associations with other ejecta signatures. We suggest that the Omni plasma data can provide information on the rate of ejecta passing the Earth, and hence give an indication of the CME rate, for a period commencing before spacecraft coronagraph CME observations became available in the early 1970s. Our findings suggest that Tp depressions may provide a more comprehensive indication of the presence of ejecta than other ejecta signatures, such as bidirectional solar wind electron heat fluxes and energetic ion flows, which alone do not identify all ejecta.},

	abstract = {Abstract We provide a preliminary interpretation of the Rover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS) pressure data from the first 100 Martian solar days (sols) of the Mars Science Laboratory mission. The pressure sensor is performing well and has revealed the existence of phenomena undetected by previous missions that include possible gravity waves excited by evening downslope flows, relatively dust-free convective vortices analogous in structure to dust devils, and signatures indicative of the circulation induced by Gale Crater and its central mound. Other more familiar phenomena are also present including the thermal tides, generated by daily insolation variations, and the CO2 cycle, driven by the condensation and sublimation of CO2 in the polar regions. The amplitude of the thermal tides is several times larger than those seen by other landers primarily because Curiosity is located where eastward and westward tidal modes constructively interfere and also because the crater circulation amplifies the tides to some extent. During the first 100 sols tidal amplitudes generally decline, which we attribute to the waning influence of the Kelvin wave. Toward the end of the 100 sol period, tidal amplitudes abruptly increased in response to a nearby regional dust storm that did not expand to global scales. Tidal phases changed abruptly during the onset of this storm suggesting a change in the interaction between eastward and westward modes. When compared to Viking Lander 2 data, the REMS daily average pressures show no evidence yet for the 1–20 Pa increase expected from the possible loss of CO2 from the south polar residual cap.},

	abstract="We describe an instrument (SMEI) which has been specifically designed to detect and forecast the arrival 
	of solar mass ejections and other heliospheric structures which are moving towards the Earth. Such events may cause 
	geomagnetic storms, with resulting radiation hazards and disruption to military and commercial communications; 
	damage to Earth-orbiting spacecraft; and also terrestrial effects such as surges in transcontinental power 
	transmission lines. The detectors are sensitive over the optical wave-band, which is measured using CCD cameras. 
	SMEI was launched on 6 January 2003 on the Coriolis spacecraft into a Sun-synchronous polar orbit as part of the US 
	DoD Space Test Programme. The instrument contains three cameras, each with a field of view of 
	60{\textdegree}{\texttimes}3{\textdegree}, which are mounted onto the spacecraft such that they scan most of the 
	sky every 102-min orbit. The sensitivity is such that changes in sky brightness equivalent to a tenth magnitude 
	star in one square degree of sky may be detected. Each camera takes an image every 4 s. The normal telemetry rate 
	is 128 kbits s−1. In order to extract the emission from a typical large coronal mass ejection, stellar images and 
	the signal from the zodiacal dust cloud must be subtracted. This requires accurate relative photometry to 0.1{\%}. 
	One consequence is that images of stars and the zodiacal cloud will be measured to this photometric accuracy once 
	per orbit. This will enable studies of transient zodiacal cloud phenomena, flare stars, supernovae, comets, and 
	other varying point-like objects.",
