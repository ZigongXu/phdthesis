	abstract = {The propagation of 15 interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) from Earth's orbit (1 AU) to Mars (∼1.5 AU) has been studied with their propagation speed estimated from both measurements and simulations. The enhancement of magnetic fields related to ICMEs and their shock fronts causes the so-called Forbush decrease, which can be detected as a reduction of galactic cosmic rays measured on ground. We have used galactic cosmic ray (GCR) data from in situ measurements at Earth, from both STEREO A and STEREO B as well as GCR measurements by the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) instrument on board Mars Science Laboratory on the surface of Mars. A set of ICME events has been selected during the periods when Earth (or STEREO A or STEREO B) and Mars locations were nearly aligned on the same side of the Sun in the ecliptic plane (so-called opposition phase). Such lineups allow us to estimate the ICMEs' transit times between 1 and 1.5 AU by estimating the delay time of the corresponding Forbush decreases measured at each location. We investigate the evolution of their propagation speeds before and after passing Earth's orbit and find that the deceleration of ICMEs due to their interaction with the ambient solar wind may continue beyond 1 AU. We also find a substantial variance of the speed evolution among different events revealing the dynamic and diverse nature of eruptive solar events. Furthermore, the results are compared to simulation data obtained from two CME propagation models, namely the Drag-Based Model and ENLIL plus cone model.},

	large data set collected by HI makes it possible to analyze 149 ICMEs propagating toward MSL both during its 
	8-month cruise phase and after its landing on Mars. We link 45 of the events observed at STEREO-HI to their 
	corresponding FDs at MSL/RAD and study the accuracy of the ICME arrival time at Mars predicted from HI data using 
	different methods. The mean differences between the predicted arrival times and those observed using FDs range from 
	−11–5 hr for the different methods, with standard deviations between 17 and 20 hr. These values for predictions at

	abstract = {Forbush decreases (FDs), which are short-term drops in the flux of galactic cosmic rays (GCR), are caused by the shielding from strong and/or turbulent magnetic structures in the solar wind, especially interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) and their associated shocks, as well as corotating interaction regions (CIRs). Such events can be observed at Earth, e.g. using neutron monitors, but also at many other locations in the solar system, such as on the surface of Mars with the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) instrument onboard Mars Science Laboratory (MSL). They are often used as a proxy for detecting the arrival of ICMEs or CIRs, especially when sufficient in situ solar wind measurements are not available. We compare the properties of FDs observed at Earth and Mars, focusing on events produced by ICMEs. We find that FDs at both locations show a correlation between their total amplitude and the maximum hourly decrease, but with different proportionality factors. We explain this difference using theoretical modelling approaches and suggest that it is related to the size increase of ICMEs, and in particular their sheath regions, en route from Earth to Mars. From the FD data, we can derive the sheath broadening factor to be between about 1.5 and 1.9, agreeing with our theoretical considerations. This factor is also in line with previous measurements of the sheath evolution closer to the Sun.},

As the solar particle event flux was gradually declining, a shock front reached Mars and caused a sudden drop of about 15\% in instantaneous dose rates. No solar particles followed the shock arrival, and the magnetic shielding of galactic cosmic rays by the shock reduced their intensity to levels below those seen before the start of the event.

@article{Guo-2018,
	abstract = {On 10 September 2017, solar energetic particles originating from the active region 12673 produced a ground level enhancement at Earth. The ground level enhancement on the surface of Mars, 160 longitudinally east of Earth, observed by the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) was the largest since the landing of the Curiosity rover in August 2012. Based on multipoint coronagraph images and the Graduated Cylindrical Shell model, we identify the initial 3-D kinematics of an extremely fast coronal mass ejection (CME) and its shock front, as well as another two CMEs launched hours earlier with moderate speeds. The three CMEs interacted as they propagated outward into the heliosphere and merged into a complex interplanetary CME (ICME). The arrival of the shock and ICME at Mars caused a very significant Forbush decrease seen by RAD only a few hours later than that at Earth, which was about 0.5 AU closer to the Sun. We investigate the propagation of the three CMEs and the merged ICME together with the shock, using the drag-based model and the WSA-ENLIL plus cone model constrained by the in situ observations. The synergistic study of the ICME and solar energetic particle arrivals at Earth and Mars suggests that to better predict potentially hazardous space weather impacts at Earth and other heliospheric locations for human exploration missions, it is essential to analyze (1) the eruption of the flare and CME at the Sun, (2) the CME kinematics, especially during their interactions, and (3) the spatially and temporally varying heliospheric conditions, such as the evolution and propagation of the stream interaction regions.},

Simultaneously, Hurricanes Irma and Jose caused significant damage to the Caribbean Islands and parts of Florida. The coincidental timing of both the space weather activity and hurricanes was unfortunate, as HF radio was needed for emergency communications. This paper presents the response of HF amateur radio propagation as observed by the Reverse Beacon Network and the Weak Signal Propagation Reporting Network to the space weather events of that period. Distributed data coverage from these dense sources provided a unique mix of global and regional coverage of ionospheric response and recovery that revealed several features of storm time HF propagation dynamics. X-class flares on 6, 7, and 10 September caused acute radio blackouts during the day in the Caribbean with recovery times of tens of minutes to hours, based on the decay time of the flare. A severe geomagnetic storm with Kpmax = 8+ and SYM-Hmin = −146 nT occurring 7–10 September wiped out ionospheric communications first on 14 MHz and then on 7 MHz starting at ∼1200 UT 8 September. This storm, combined with affects from additional flare and geomagnetic activity, contributed to a significant suppression of effective HF propagation bands both globally and in the Caribbean for a period of 12 to 15 days.},

    abstract = {Abstract Two solar proton events in September 2017 had a significant impact on the operation of the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN), a global network of high-frequency (HF) radars designed for observing F region ionospheric plasma convection. Strong polar cap absorption caused near-total loss of radar backscatter, which prevented the primary SuperDARN data products from being determined for a period of several days. During this interval, the high-latitude and polar cap radars measured unusually low levels of background atmospheric radio noise. We demonstrate that these background noise measurements can be used to observe the spatial and temporal evolution of the polar cap absorption region, using an approach similar to riometry. We find that the temporal evolution of the SuperDARN radar-derived HF attenuation closely follows that of the cosmic noise absorption measured by a riometer. Attenuation of the atmospheric noise up to 10 dB at 12 MHz is measured within the northern polar cap, and up to 14 dB in the southern polar cap, which is consistent with the observed backscatter loss. Additionally, periods of enhanced attenuation lasting 2–4 hr are detected by the midlatitude radars in response to M- and X-class solar flares. Our results demonstrate that SuperDARN's routine measurements of atmospheric radio noise can be used to monitor 8- to 20-MHz radio attenuation from middle to polar latitudes, which may be used to supplement riometer data and also to investigate the causes of SuperDARN backscatter loss during space weather events.},

The flare itself was the highlight of a quite interesting phase of solar-terrestrial interactions caused by the active region known as the Catania sunspot group 46 or active region number 2673 on the NOAA catalog. From 3 to 13 September 2017 strong flare activities occurred, accompanied by a number of radio bursts and earthward-directed coronal mass ejections. Solar wind influences at Earth were modest during the flare activity and limited to the polar regions (Linty et al., 2018, https://doi.org/10.1029/2018SW001940). But, the strong X9.3 flare itself had impacts on the dayside ionosphere causing some problems in navigation services as we present within this paper. The event data observed and analyzed give us the opportunity to improve our understanding of strong and extreme space weather events and allow us to distinguish between the influence of the different event classes on our technological infrastructure within periods of strong solar activity. Here we will discuss our observations with special focus on the X9.3 flare event and provide examples how the flare itself influenced services in the domains of aviation and maritime navigation in the European sector.},

The solar radio noise reduced the signal-to-noise ratio with clear frequency dependence. The impact of the radio burst has been found at L2 and L5 frequencies, but not at L1 frequency. The ground observation of the solar radio spectrum between 1.0 and 2.0 GHz corresponds well to such frequency dependence. The maximum signal-to-noise ratio reduction of -10 dB was found when the solar radio flux was pulsating around 2,000 solar flux unit level. Precise point positioning results show that accuracy is reduced with stronger deviation for dual-frequency solutions than for single-frequency solutions based on L1 signal only. The positioning error refers rather to the solar extreme ultraviolet flare than to solar radio interferences. The results presented here are a clear indication of frequency-dependent GNSS performance degradation during strong space weather events.},
