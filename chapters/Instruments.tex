Chang'E-4 is a robotic spacecraft mission of China exploring the lunar far-side surface, which is also the first human soft-landing missions on the lunar far-side surface \citep{Li2021SSRv}. The whole mission consists of a lander, a rover named Yutu-2 and a relay sattellite named Queqiao which works in the lunar orbit and enables the communication between the lunar far-side surface and the ground. The mission was launched on December 8, 2018 and successfully landed on the Von K\`arm\`an crater near the south pole of Moon on January 3, 2019 \citep{Wu2019NatGe}. In order to cope with the significant temperature variations on the lunar surface, the rover, lander, and scientific payloads onboard enter a hibernation state during the approximately two-week-long lunar night. This mode helps conserve energy power and protect the detectors.  After the extended 'sleep' night, the instruments onboard are awakened by sunlight and start operating during the daytime. The initial design life time of the mission was set at a minimum of one year. Obviously this target have been successfully surpassed and the scientific instruments onboard are continuing performing impressive measurements.

As an integral part of the Chang'E-4 mission's international scientic payload, \ac{LND}\acused{LND} is designed by the Kiel University in Germany. An \ac{LND} was displayed in Fig.~\ref{Fig:LND_instrument}. The initial designed purpose of \ac{LND} is to measure the first active radiation dose rate and monitor the radiation environment caused by the changed and neutral (neutrons and $\gamma$-ray) particles, as an preparation of the future human exploration to the Moon and solar system. 
The main scientific objects of LND, as indicated in the instrument paper \citep{Wimmer-2020-LND}, are the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Dosimetry for human exploration of the Moon}: LND is designed to determine the temperal variations of the dose rate and the LET spectra which will be used to derived the quality factor \textit{Q} which is an key factor to interprete the dosimetric data.
    \item \emph{Contribution to the heliospheric science}: The particle fluxes and time series of the flux are measured on the far-side of the Moon. This unique measurement location provides valuable insights into the propagation of the particles in the heliosphere.
\end{itemize}
\ac{LND} also has two technological demonstration objects which are Determine the subsurface water content in the South-Pole Aitken Basin and Determine the FeO content in the South-Pole Aitken Basin \citep{Wimmer-2020-LND}.

To achieve the aforementioned scientific objectives, LND measures and provides the data products including up to 1-minute charged and neutral particle dose rate measured in Si, up to 1-minute cadence \ac{LET} spectra, 1-minute neutral particle deposition energy spectra, 10-minutes count rates of thermal neutrons and high time resolution (1-minutes, 10-minutes) charged particles flux and high energy resolution spectra including electrons and ions from proton to iron.

As of May 2023, LND has been successfully working on the lunar far-side surface for more than 4 years, which corresponding to approximately 50 Lunar days since Jan 3, 2019. It has largely surpassed its designed lifetime.
One of the simplest way to check whether LND is working or not is looking up during night and checking whether the moon phase. If you can see a new moon or the moon in the last/first quarter phase, it indicates that moon is moving out of the earth's shadow and that the far-side surface of moon is facing the sun, enabling the \ac{LND} work.

Based the the operations and experiment schedule established from the ground, \ac{LND} has been completely or partly (more than half lunar day) switched off on the 6th, 44th, 45th lunar days. As of the finalization of this thesis in May 2023, we have received 46 lunar days data from January 2019 to the end of November 2022 which are stored in the server of Kiel University. The data have officially been publishing in the Lunar and Planetary Data release system \footnote{\url{moon.bao.ac.cn}}, where you could find the data until December 2022. 
The alternative downloading options include NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive and, ESA's archive ESDC (ESAC Science Data Center) which are still in building. The instrument will continue its operation in the lunar far side and we anticipate to receive can receive more intriguing data in the future with the increasing solar activities.


It is important to highlight that several configuration changes have been implemented after \ac{LND} delivered and launched. Those configuration changes is reflected in 14 extra commands, which are uploaded to control unit of \ac{LND} every morning of lunar day, fixing software issues and malfunction issue. The software issues arise from errors in the software pipeline where the control unit use the wrong channels to determine the particle energy and we made mistakes in the simulation when design the data products. The later affects the position of \ac{dps} boxes in the X-mas plot (See below and \citet{Wimmer-2020-LND} for more details). Neverthless, the impact on the data products is minor. 

The significant changes of the data products are mainly caused by raising the threshold of noise channels and removing A2 channel (the outer segement of front A detector, see Appendix in Sec.~\ref{chp:LND_GCR_albedo} for more details of the changes) in the level 3 trigger logic. The reason of such changes are due the high noise level observed in detectors A, G, H, I and J. 
On the 3rd and 4th lunar day, \ac{LND} was switched off for a short periods but left the lid open, which should have been closed to keep the sensor warm. Though the temperature on the lunar surface have increased as the sun rose, \ac{LND} and its detectors keep losing heat after being switched off, hence temperature of sensor head drop dramastically. Such a temperature variation caused an irreversible deformation to the carrier and its attached detectors, particularly the detector A and I/J in the front side and bottom side. Consequently, the lower energy noise ($\sim$ 10 - 200 keV) experienced a significant increase.

By implemmenting the aforementioned changes, we have sucessfully reduced the noise level and mitigated its impact on the primary data products such as \ac{LET} spectra. However, it is worth noting that these changes still resulted in significant consequences for several data products. For instance, we partly lose the measurement of \acp{MIP} after the increment of the threshold of I detector; the geometry factors of two \ac{LET} spectra and penetrating particle are reduced dramatically after disabling the A2 channel, which plays a key role in \ac{LND}'s measurement logic. For a better understanding of the configuration changes and their impact on the data products, please refer to the appendix of chapter \ref{chp:LND_GCR_albedo}.
The corresponding changes of the original code in the LND data processing pipeline is given in the appendix ~\ref{chp:appendix_LND_data_process_pipeline}.



\subsection{LND as Charged particle telescope}

\ac{LND} has an special designed sensor head that enable it to be used as a dosimeter, neutral telescope and charged particle telescope. We will put our focus on the charged particle telescope in this section and a brief introduction to the other two components are given in the next section for a comprehensive overview of LND's capability.

The flight spare model of \ac{LND} which is an exact replica of the flight model currently deployed on the moon is displayed in Fig.\ref{Fig:LND_instrument}. The instrument is composed of two seperate parts, the \ac{SH} in the front and the \ac{EB} at the rear. \ac{SH} and \ac{EB} are connected by a 1-meter cable which serves to provide power and transfer data. 
The \ac{SH} comprises 10 Si \acs{SSD} of norminal 500 $\mu$m thickness. They are labeled from A to J and assembled in a charged-particle telescope configuration as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{Fig:LND_sensor_head}.

The structure of the telescope can be further divied into two parts. The upper half consists of four detectors (A, B, C, D) with A placed quite away from the others. A detector is the crucial one in \ac{LND} sensor head, since the charged particle data products only register particles that have triggered the front detector A. B/C/D are assembled closely in the space in order to perform an anti-coincidence measuremet in the inner C segements. Such a detector arrangement is similar to the Flight Radiation Environment Detector (FRED) \citep{moeller-etal-2013, moeller-etal-2013b}. The lower half consists of three detector pairs (E/F, G/H, I/J) and an Al-Gd-Al absorber. The detector paris are closely packed together and the absorber is designed for the thermal neutrons. A 20 $\mu$m thickness Gd foils is inserted into E/F and G/H, creating sandwich-like tructures to detect the thermal neutrons. This charged particle telescope is completed by the last detector pair I/J.

By measuring the energy depostion in different \acp{SSD} and using the dE/dX - E or dE/dX - dE/dX method, depending on the primary energy of particle, LND can easily identify the particles energy and species. 
The averaged energy loss of the charged particle along their travel path depends on the nuclear charge $Z_1$ (equal to atomic number) and the incident velocity $\nu$. 
Such relationship could be expressed by the well-known Bethe-Bloch formula \citep{bethe-1930, bloch-1933}:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\dd E}{\dd x} = - \frac{Z_1^2 e^4 n_e}{4 \pi \cdot \varepsilon_0^2 \beta^2 c^2 m_e} \cdot \left[ \ln\left(\frac{2 m_e  \beta^2 c^2}{{E_B}}\right) - \ln(1 - \beta^2) - \beta^2  \right], 
    \label{eq:BB}
  \end{equation}
where $c$ is the speed of light, $\beta = \nu/c$, $E_B$ is the ionization energy of the medium that particle pass, and $n_e$ is the electron density in the medium, $m_e$ is the electron mass, and constant $epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space.

In the energy range that \ac{LND} covered, $ln(\beta^2)$ is nearly constant and slowly changes, hence the above function could be simplified as:
\begin{equation}
    E_A \propto \frac{Z_1^2 m_1}{E_{\mathrm tot}},
    \label{eq:BB2}
\end{equation}
The products of $E_A$ and $E_{tot}$ is proportional to the nuclear charge (atomic number) and the mass of elements. These parameters depend depend on the particle species and allow for determination of particle composition of particles It is worth noting that \ac{LND} has the capability of discriminate between the isotopes of elements, such as Helium-3 and Helium-4, despite the limited resolution and larger uncertainty in the Xmas plot (Fig.~\ref{Fig:measurement_Xmas}, See Appendix \ref{chp:appendix_LND_He3_spectra})

%The nuclear charge $Z_1$ is equal to the number of protons in the nucleus, i.e. the atomic number $Z$ of the elements. Therefore, the telescope like \ac{LND} can not determine the particle charge state and we could not tell apart fully charged \ac{GCR} and singly charged \ac{ACR}. When traversing the front foil and \acp{SSD} of \ac{LND} sensor head, those partially charged particle will be ionized and stripped the electrons, becoming fully charged \citet{Swaczyna2017ApJ}.


ONce the charged particle enter the sensor head of \ac{LND}, they can be further categoried into two groups: stopping particle and penetrating particles. Stopping particles have primary energy range between $\sim$ 8 MeV/nuc and $\sim$ 35 MeV/nuc, stopping within the detector B-I. While penetrating particles possess energy above this range and have capability penetrate through all the detectors. In Fig.~\ref{Fig:LND-Boehm-plot}, a plot generated by the large counting statistic \ac{Geant4} \citep{Agostinelli-2003} simulation illustrates how the stopping particles are seperated by using the $E_{tot} * E_A$ as the y-axis and $E_{tot} / E_A$ as the x-axis. The data points simulated in \ac{Geant4} based on a carefully construced \ac{LND} instrument model. This model takes into account all the inner structures within the sensor head, including PCB next to the detector stacks and the outer shell of sensor head. However, we must note that a completed model including the surrounding material of \ac{LND} is unavaiable since we lack the structure information of the Chang\'E-4 lander.
A screenshot of the \ac{LND} model is provided in the appendix \ref{chp:LNDsimulation}. 

Penetrating particles have primary energy above approximately 35 MeV/nuc, and as the name suggested, can penetrate through detectors A to I and stop in J or continue to penetrate J with more energy. The majority of the penetrating particles are fully penetrating particles, which means we can not directly measure their total energy. The \acp{MIP} are one of the fully penetrating particles that have extremely large initial energy from hundreds MeV to GeV but only deposit minimal amount of energy in the detector stacks.
Since the total energy of particle are unavaiable, it is not possible to create a plot similar to Fig.~\ref{Fig:LND-Boehm-plot}. Instead, we change the formula of x-axis and y-axis to $E_I/E_A$ and $dE$ respectively. The $E_I$ is the energy deposit in the last detector I. The $dE$ is the energy deposition summed from the B, C, and D.

Notably the incident direction of the particle i.e. whether they come from above or beneath the detector, could be inferred from the penetrating data. Typically, for the particle incident from above, the ratio $E_I/E_A$ tends to be larger than 1 and while for the beneath incident particle, this value tends to be less than 1. 
By analyzing the distributions and patterns in the histogram, we can identify the albedo protons from the 2-D histogram of penetrating particles, corresponding to columns 248 - 264 in the Xmas plot (Fig.~\ref{Fig:measurement_Xmas}).
The detailed understanding of the derivations and analysis of albedo protons could be inferred from Section. ~\ref{chp:LND_GCR_albedo}

\subsection{LND as dosimeter and neutral telescope}

\ac{LND} measure the \ac{TID} on the B inner segement utilizing the energy deposition and corresponding energy spectrum. The C inner segement, which is surrouded by the B, D and C outer detector and in anti-coincidence with all other detector segments, is used to measure the neutral dose rate including both fast neutron and $\gamma$-rays radiation. The above two measurements are the primary data products of \ac{LND}. The data have good quality and play an important role in assessing the radiation environment on the lunar surface. 

\ac{LND} employs the E/F, G/H pairs which clamp a Gd-foil, to measure the thermal neutron flux. The Gd-foil has a large cross section for the thermal nentron and have larger possibibity interact with those neutrons. In the calibration experiment, \ac{LND} successfully measured the neutrons by comparing the energy spectrum discrepancy between E (G) and F (H) for neutrons coming from front (back) \citet{Wimmer2020SSRv}.
However, in real measurements, the quality of thermal neutron data is unexpectedly low due to various factors. One of significant factors is the neutron background emitted from the \ac{RTG} and \ac{RHU}. These radioactive sources generate heat to protect the lander and payload from the frozen night. But they also contribute largerly on the neutron background \citep{Zhang2020SciAdv}. Unfortunately, the direct measurement of those radiaion sources is unavaiable, and only an experimental and empirical estimation of the contamination of the background on the data were conducted by \citep{Hou2020-LNDbackground}, based on the laboratory data on the Earth and mento-carlo simulations. The results confirmed the non-negligible background interference and provides the first attempt to remove the background from dose rate measurement. 

Another factors that might affect the neutron measurements are the unanticipated noise increase in these detectors. Similar to the noise issue observed in other channels, channels F2, G2 and H1 have also been troubled by the increased noise level. The L1 counters experienced the increased count rate from $10^3$ count/min to $10^6$ count/min. The energy spectrum show the dominant energy below 300 keV. 
The determination of thermal neutrons relies on the several electron lines below 200 keV
However, such higher energy noise can obscure the real thermal neutron signal, make it even challenging to extract accurate thermal neutron data despite its lower intensity.
Furthermore, significant dead time issues arise in the neutron dose which measured in C since the neutron measurements share the same counter buffer. To mitigate these issue, the corresponding threshold of noise detector need to be raised to few hundreds keV, resulting in the loss of the thermal neutrons data.

The remain data products related to the radiation are \ac{LET} spectrum. \ac{LND} provide three type of \ac{LET} spectra including \ac{LET} $ABC\bar{I}$, $\bar{A}BIJ$ and $ABIJ$. Those \ac{LET} spectra can be used to derived the quality factor (Q) which multiple the absorbed dose rate, deriving the dose equivalent.
In the appendix of chapter \ref{chp:LND_GCR_albedo}, we provide the change of geometry factor of the LET spectra due to implement of the configuration changes.
More details of the data products can be found in the instrument paper \citet{Wimmer2020SSRv}.

The first scientific result of \ac{LND} regarding the radiation environment on the lunar surface are reported in \citep{Zhang-2020-LND-firstresults}. These initial findings present the \ac{TID}, neutron dose and \ac{LET} spectra of the first two lunar day. This is first ever dynamic measurement of the radiation variation on the lunar surface. Based on the measurement, the averaged total absorbed dose rate in silicon is about 13.59$\pm$1.01 $\mu$Gy/hour. Amongst this total dose rate, the contribution from neutral particles is estimated to be $3.10 \pm 0.43 \mu$Gy/hour. These result offer valuable insights into the radiation environment on the lunar surface and provide a basis for further analysis.



\subsection{Primary data products: Xmas plots}
\label{sec:xmas}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width =\textheight, height = 0.6\textheight, angle = 90]{images/xmas-2019-01-03To2022-11-29.png}
    \caption[LND Xmas plot based on the measurement]{The completed Xmas plot (274 $\times$ 64) of \ac{LND} based on the measurement between 2019.1.3 and 2022.11.29. All the data products could be found in this matrix, including neutrals, \ac{LET} spectra, \ac{TID}, stopping and penetrating charged particles, including electron, protoon, helium and heavy ions. The corresponding simulation version could be found in \citep{Wimmer2020SSRv}}
    \label{Fig:measurement_Xmas}
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{Fig:measurement_Xmas} is the so-called "Xmas plot" \footnote{It was the front cover of the Xmas card of IEAP group in 2017. Hence we named it Xmas plot} of the \ac{LND}. Xmas plot is an image of \ac{LND}'s memory space shaped in a 274 $\times$ 64 matrix, where each pixel in the Xmas plot servers as a counter. In principle all data products are extracted from this matrix. 
When \ac{LND} detects the deposited energy in detectors of an effective signal, the control units will calculate onboard the appropriate position in the Xmas plot and increment the corresponding counter. 

Unlike the simulated plot in \citep{Wimmer2020SSRv}, here we showcase Xmas plot from the real measurements between 2019.1.3 to 2022.11.29, encompassing all the data accumulated since the first lunar day. The green rows are the memory space that will not be transmitted to the ground, in order to save the telemetry bandwidth. 
For a more detailed explanation of the format of the Xmas plot, I recommend referring to \citep{Wimmer2020SSRv}.

%The major different compared with the Xmas plot in \citep{Wimmer2020SSRv} is that LND measure not only the particle incident from above but also the albedo particles moving upward, while in the simulation, we did add the albedo component. It is obvious that in the penetrating panel of Xmas plot,  a higher than backgrond branch strech from middle to the left side. This branch represents the protons moving upward with enough energy fully penetrating all the detectors as well as the extra shielding from the lander structure. More details of how to derive albedo proton flux are given in Section.~\ref{sec:albedo_proton}.


\section{Solar orbiter and High energy telescope}

Successfully launched on Feb 10, 2020, \ac{SolO} missions \citep{Mueller-2020-SolO} is an international mission cooperated between \ac{ESA} and \ac{NASA} with the aim to understand the sun and how it control the so-called helisphere. As indicated in the mission paper, the following scientific questions will be answered and further studied: (a). What drives the solar wind and where dose the coronal magnetic field originate from? (b). How do solar transients drive heliospheric variability? (c). How do solar eruptions produce energetic particles radiation that fills the heliosphere? (d). How does the solar dynamo work and drive connections between the Sun and the heliosphere?

%After finishing the cuise phase which started at June 14, 2020, \ac{SolO} has been operating in the nominla mission phase since Nov 26, 2021 as scheduled.

The \ac{SolO} has a special designed elliptic helioscentric orbit with the closest perihelion of 0.29 AU (about 42$\times10^6$ km). Using several gravity assistance during the Venus flyby and Earth flyby, the orbit of \ac{SolO} will gradually tilt away from the ecliptic plane and in the end can be 24 degrees above the Sun's equator. As of May 2023 \ac{SolO} is still following an elliptical orbit circling the sun, with a maximum solar latitude of 8.66 degrees. \ac{SolO} has finished 5 perihelions with closest distance of 0.292 AU on Sep 3, 2022, and has started its 6th orbit, moving away the Sun. Benefiting from the unique position of \ac{SolO} during this trip, the multiple scientific instruments onboard the \ac{SolO} could further advanced our understanding of the sun and its affects on the heliosphere.
%Three time Venus flyby happened on Dec 27, 2020,  Aug 9, 2021 and Sep 4, 2022. The Earth GAM happend on Now 27, 2021.
%The above mentioned solo tragjectory information is taken from the Solar orbiter Consolidated Report on Mission analysis \footnotes{\url{https://issues.cosmos.esa.int/solarorbiterwiki/display/SOSP/Trajectory+Overview+-+10+February+2020+Launch}}

%in the relative field for instance the questions regarding solar coronal, solar magnetic field, solar wind, \ac{SEP}.
\ac{EPD} \citep{RodriguezPacheco-2019-EPD} is one of such scientific payload suite onboard \ac{SolO}, measuring the energetic particles over a large scale from few kev to GeV. The spectra, composition, time variations and directional distributions could be obtained and derived.
\ac{EPD} comprises four different sensors, \ac{SIS}, \ac{STEP}, \ac{EPT} and \ac{HET}. 
\ac{SIS} is a time-of-flight mass spectrometer that measures ion composition from $\sim$ 0.1 - few MeV nucleon$^{-1}$. \ac{STEP} measures electrons and ions with lower energies between 4 keV and 80 keV. The special design of \ac{STEP} allows it to have high pitch-angle resolution.
\ac{EPT} and \ac{HET} share the same electronics and they are composed of two identical sensor units that are assembled perpendicularly on \ac{SolO}. This configuration enables detection of the particle incident from four different directions. \ac{EPT} is designed to measure medium-energy electrons and ions within the energy range of 25 keV to 400 keV ($\sim$ 6 MeV for protons), while \ac{HET} completes the higher energy end, measuring electrons from 300 keV to 30 MeV and ions from 6.8 Mev/nuc to $\sim$ 100 MeV/nuc in the nominal data products. Notably, the penetrating data products of \ac{HET} could extend the energy coverage of \ac{HET} up to $\sim$ GeV/nuc \citep{Elftmann-2020-PhD}.
The completed energy coverage of those four instruments for different particle species are given in Fig.~\ref{Fig:EPD-energy-coverage}.
In this section, we provide a brief introduction of \ac{HET}, which is the focus of this study. Further more detailed information of the other components can be found in the instrument paper \citet{RodriguezPacheco-2019-EPD} and the first years overview paper from \citet{Wimmer2021AA}.

The HET measurements are splited into stopping and penetrating parts and the later one can largely extend \ac{HET}'s capability \citep{Elftmann-2020-PhD}.}
    \label{Fig:EPD-energy-coverage}
\end{figure}  

\subsection{High energy telescope}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{images/het.png}
    \caption[The \ac{HET} sensor head]{The cross profile of HET sensor head. The detector names are labeled. Figure is reproduced from \citep{RodriguezPacheco-2019-EPD}}
    \label{fig:HET-sensor-head}
\end{figure}

\ac{HET} is a double-ended telescope. The cross profile of the \ac{HET} sensor head is depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:HET-sensor-head}. The sensor head of \ac{HET} consists of four 300 $\mu$m silicon \ac{SSD} stacks, with two in each side (A1, B1 in the front side and A2, B2 in the back side), and a 2-cm thickness \ac{BGO} ($Bi_{4}Ge_{3}O_{12}$) scintillator which is named as detector C in the center. The sensor head setup is similar to the configuration of \ac{RAD}, another instrument developed by Kiel Univeristy, which is currently operating on the Mars surface.  

HET use the $\mathrm{dE/dX - E}$ technique to discriminates different particle species of different energy. This method is the same as the measurement principle of \ac{LND} that has been well explained before. The particle species that \ac{LND} can discriminate include electron, proton, helium-4, and all heavy ions such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and iron.  

Once the charged particle incident and penetrate the A detector (A1 or A2), they can be splited into the stopping particle and penetrating particle, depending on their energy and whether they stop in detector B/C. As given in Table 22 of \citet{RodriguezPacheco-2019-EPD}, the corresponding nominal data products, are ABnC, which is corresponding to particles stopping in B and have energy of 6.5 - 9.5 Me/nuc, and ABC which register particles stopping in C with energy range of $\sim$10 - $\sim$ 100 MeV/nuc and penetrating detector C with energy above 100 MeV/nuc up to infinity. 

%For the penetrating particle, their primary energy can be estimated based on the energy loss on the detector and the \ac{Geant4} simulation. The aforementioned nominal data products of HET contribute to the study of \ac{SEP}, \ac{ACR} and \ac{GCR}.


In addition to the nominal charged particle data products, it is important to emphasize the significant contribution of housekeeping data in our studies.
The housekeeping data are \ac{EPD} sensor produced instrumental data.They have the highest priority for downlink to the Earth and are used to monitoring the instrument status and health. Although the housekeeping data are not designed for scientific purpose, they still provide valuable insight into the instrument performance and their contributions in the scientific study is impressive \citep{Wimmer2021AA}.


One of such data is the single detector counter which register signals in the \ac{BGO} scintillator crystal. This counter does not require any coincidence condition and response to particles from all directions and types. The sole requirement is that the deposited energy exceeds the threshold of the C detector. Due to its larger geometry factor, this counter exhibits better counting statistics and can be used to detect the small disturbance in the \ac{GCR} background. For example \citep{Forstner-2021-SolO} use this counter to study the \ac{FD} with an ampliude of 3\% when a \ac{CME} pass \ac{SolO} on 19 April 2020. Additionaly, \citep{Allen2021AA_venus} found that the 5\% drop in the count rates is due to the plant body blockage on the \ac{FOV} of \ac{HET} during the first venus fly by.

Similar to the single detector count rate, we also utilize the L2 counter named \textit{any(a1, b1)} to determine the periods of \ac{SEP}. This counter sums up every singals that trigger the A1 and B1 detectors in the sensor head, regardless of the primary energy and the particle species. Background of this counter is dominated by the \acp{GCR} and temporal increase indicates the incoming of \ac{SEP}. The data product exhibits better counting statistics than the nominal science data products which is designed to derive the flux. Additionally, \textit{any(a1, b1)} is more sensitive to the \acp{SEP} because it has lower energy threshold of $\sim$ 50 keV compared with C counter \citep{Elftmann-2020-PhD}. Even the electron and ions with energy below 1 MeV could trigger this counter. As a result, \textit{any(a1, b1)} is particularly useful in determining the start and end time of the \ac{SEP} events, no matter what types of particles triggered. In Section~\ref{chp:ACR_Helium}, we remove the period of \ac{SEP} determined by this method, trying to obtain a accurate measurement for the \ac{ACR} study.
