(This this the start page of the LND GCR and albedo protons)


The moon is expose to the deep space. 


GCE from outside of Solar system, accelerated by the shock wave.


From 2019.1 to 2020.7, apart from the SEP event that we studied in the last chapter, no SEPs arrived on the lunar surface during this period, 
hence it is a good opportunity to study the galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) and the albedo protons.




GCR dominate the quite time
LND start from solar minimum, good opptunity to study the GCR
