Apart from the \acs{SEP}, the long lasting \ac{GCR} and the albedo protons which are the products of the interaction between \ac{GCR} and lunar regolith are another two important components of the plasma environment and radiation hazard on the lunar surface. [citation]
The GCR are the high energy particles that originate from the outside of the solar system and spread in the heliosphere. (exists everywhere - the words)
The \ac{GCR} are the primary particle and the basis of all radiation problem in the space the in the planetry.
After they  arrived at the planetary surface, the secondary particlce and albedo particle are generated by the interaction between the \ac{GCR} and the planetary atmosphere or the regolith.  [citation]
The secondary particle includes many type of particle, neutron, proton, alpha particle, etc

Interaction of GCR with the planet
- On the Earth 
    - The process generate the secondary particle
    - Neutron particles	
    
    
- Interaction with Lunar
- Interact with Mars 




From 2019.7 to 2020.7, no SEPs arrived on the lunar surface during this period, hence it is a good opportunity to study the \acs{GCR} without the interference of the solar energetic particle.

At the sametime, benefit from the advanced structure of \ac{LND}'s charged particle telescope, we design a new data product after LND delivered and launched to the lunar surface. Such a data products allow us measure the flux of albedo proton around few tens of MeV.

\textit{Overview of the key results}
Below we brief summarized the key obseravtions and the 
As the first such measurements ever on the lunar surface, LND provide the unique observation of the quite time spectra of lower energy cosmic ray, 

\begin{itemize}
    \item The LND measurement are consistent with SOHO/EPHIN measurement between 10 - 50 MeV. 
    \item The comparison between measurement and model observations indicates the underestimation of the CREME model during the last solar minimum
    \item The albode proton measurement of LND is consistent with the albedo proton measurements from LRO/CRATER, and also consistent with the model prediction by the REDmoon model
\end{itemize}
