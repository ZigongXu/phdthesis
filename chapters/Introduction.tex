\section{Particles in the heliosphere}
\label{sec:particles_heliosphere}

Our heliosphere is a vast region in space embedded in the \ac{ISM}, which encompasses all solar system planets and extends far beyond even the Kuiper belt. 
It is filled with a thin plasma consisting of various populations of particles, many of which originate from the Sun itself. These populations can be identified in \autoref{fig:heliospheric_energy_spectrum} \citep[based on measurements by][]{Mewaldt-2001}, shown as an energy spectrum that extends over more than 7 orders of magnitude on the energy scale and about 20 orders of magnitude on the intensity scale.

    \label{fig:heliospheric_energy_spectrum}
\end{figure}
The by far most abundant population is the solar wind, a steady flow of plasma that is emitted from the Sun radially and fills the heliosphere. 
In the near-Earth space at one astronomical unit (\si{\AU}), the slow solar wind typically reaches speeds between \SIrange[range-phrase={\,and\,}]{300}{500}{\kilo\meter\per\second}.
Due to its low pressure, and therefore high plasma $\beta$, it carries the solar magnetic field with it and creates the \ac{IMF}.
As the Sun rotates, the \ac{IMF} forms an Archimedian spiral, which was named Parker spiral after Eugene N. Parker, who first developed this model of the solar wind \citep{Parker-1958}.

However, our Sun is an active star, and thus the flow of particles is not simply constant. The variability is driven by the 11-year solar cycle, a recurring reversal of the solar magnetic field that is associated with enhancements in solar activity (solar maximum) due to the increased amount of magnetic stress and reconnection processes, and low-activity periods inbetween (solar minimum).
Coronal holes, which are colder and therefore darker regions forming on the Sun, emit faster solar wind streams with speeds above approximately $\SI{600}{\kilo\meter\per\second}$. These \acp{HSS}, which are located right next to the (slow) solar wind in \autoref{fig:heliospheric_energy_spectrum}, then interact with the neighboring streams of slower wind due to their different Parker spiral curvature and form a \acl{SIR}\acused{SIR} \citep[\acs{SIR}, e.g.][]{Richardson-2018}, as shown in \autoref{fig:particles_heliosphere_illustration}.
\begin{figure}

	\caption[Sketch of some of the particle populations in the heliosphere]{Sketch of some of the particle populations in the heliosphere: slow and fast solar wind, \acsp{SIR}, \acsp{CME}, \acsp{SEP}, shocks, and \acsp{GCR}.}
	\label{fig:particles_heliosphere_illustration}
\end{figure}
\acp{SIR} are flanked by interplanetary shocks on each side, the so-called forward and reverse shocks. If a coronal hole stays stable for a longer time, these interaction regions can be observed recurrently in each solar rotation (i.e., every $\sim$27 days when observed from Earth), in which case they are called \acp{CIR}.
Furthermore, active regions on the Sun can occasionally produce solar flares, sudden and intense emissions of photons often associated with the release of high-energy ($\sim \si{\mega\electronvolt}$) \aclp{SEP}\acused{SEP} \citep[\acsp{SEP}, e.g.][]{Reames-1990}, as shown in the central area of \autoref{fig:heliospheric_energy_spectrum}. \acp{SEP} then quickly propagate out into the heliosphere from their source region, typically following the \ac{IMF} lines, as shown in \autoref{fig:particles_heliosphere_illustration}.
Solar flares are believed to be powered by the reconnection of magnetic field lines at the Sun, which leads to the release of energy and acceleration of particles.
These events often also coincide with the eruption of plasma from the solar corona in the form of a \ac{CME} at speeds up to a few thousand \si{\kilo\meter\per\second}.
Just like the solar wind, \acp{CME} carry a magnetic field with them when they propagate away from the Sun. Due to their high speed, an interplanetary shock can form in front of the \ac{CME}, followed by a turbulent sheath region.
This shock can also be efficient at accelerating additional particles to higher energies, similar to \acp{SEP} accelerated directly at the Sun.

The high end of the energy spectrum (\autoref{fig:heliospheric_energy_spectrum}) from tens of \si{\mega\electronvolt} to \si{\giga\electronvolt} is dominated by \acp{GCR}, charged particles originating from outside the heliosphere produced e.g. in stellar supernovae and entering it with a relatively constant and isotropic flux. 
Within the heliosphere, the flux of these high-energy particles is modulated by various effects: On large timescales, the variation of the \ac{IMF} intensity during the 11-year solar cycle modulates the \acp{GCR} observed in the inner solar system, so that the average \ac{GCR} flux is higher at solar minimum than at solar maximum \citep{Fisk-1980}. In addition, there are short-term modulations of \ac{GCR} due to magnetic structures in the solar wind, such as \acp{CME} and \acp{SIR}/\acp{CIR}. These are the so-called Forbush decreases, which will be the main focus of this thesis and will be further described in \autoref{sec:forbush}.

\section{Space Weather events and their detection}
\label{sec:spaceweather}

As defined by the U.S. National Space Weather Program, the term \textit{space weather} refers to ``conditions on the Sun and in the solar wind, magnetosphere, ionosphere and thermosphere that can influence the performance and reliability of spaceborne and ground-based technological systems and endanger human life or health'' \parencite{OFCM-1995}.
The aforementioned large-scale heliospheric events, such as \acp{SEP}, \acp{CME} and \acp{CIR} are all relevant to space weather. For example, the increased radiation exposure due to accelerated energetic particles can be dangerous for astronauts. Additionally, the enhanced and turbulent magnetic fields impacting spacecraft or disturbing the Earth's magnetosphere in a so-called geomagnetic storm can cause disruptions of spacecraft electronics or of electricity grids on the ground.

Thus, space weather research is focused on enhancing the understanding of these events in order to be able to more accurately predict their occurrence and propagation, including the onset time at Earth (or other locations in the solar system) and their intensity.
In the past, the investigation of heliospheric events has been mostly based on two kinds of measurements: First, remote sensing observations of the Sun and its vicinity, such as \ac{EUV} images, magnetograms and white-light coronagraph images, are available from spacecraft near Earth such as the \ac{SOHO} and the \ac{SDO}. Second, in situ observations, such as solar wind plasma measurements and magnetometers, can also be obtained from spacecraft located at the $L_1$ Lagrange point, including \ac{SOHO}, the \ac{ACE}, Wind, and the \ac{DSCOVR}.
In the last two decades, these observations have been complemented by in situ measurements from deep space heliophysics missions, such as from the two \ac{STEREO} spacecraft orbiting the Sun near \SI{1}{\AU} as well as the recent \ac{PSP} and \ac{SolO} missions, which are starting to provide valuable data from extremely close to the Sun with a larger variety of instruments and higher resolution than the Helios mission in the 1970s. In addition to observing the Sun and its corona, these missions also facilitate imaging observations of the interplanetary space using the wide field of view of their \acp{HI}. These can be used to directly track \acp{CME} all the way out to Earth (see \autoref{sec:stereohi}).

\section{Coronal mass ejections}
\label{sec:cmes}

As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:particles_heliosphere}, \acp{CME} are large-scale eruptions of plasma from the Sun that propagate outward into the heliosphere. They are often associated with flares and believed to be driven by reconnection of the coronal magnetic field (see e.g. \cite{Forbes-2000} and \cite{Kusano-2012}). \acp{CME} occur relatively frequently, on average every 4 days at solar minimum and 2.5 to 3 times per day at solar maximum \citep{Webb-1994}. The properties of \acp{CME} have a large variability: For example, their speeds can range between \SIrange[range-phrase={\,and\,}]{20}{2000}{\kilo\meter\per\second}, where the average is at about \SI{400}{\kilo\meter\per\second} and faster \acp{CME} are more likely to occur near solar maximum. Also, their longitudinal extent can vary: Very narrow (\SI{5}{\degree}) and very wide (\SI{120}{\degree}) cases have been observed, with the average being around \SI{50}{\degree} \citep{Cane-2000}. A classic example of a \ac{CME} observed by the C3 coronagraph of the \ac{SOHO} \ac{LASCO} is shown in \autoref{subfig:cme_remotesensing}. The black circle in the center of the coronagraph image is the occulter that covers the solar disk, and the \ac{CME} appears over the solar north pole as the source region is located far north of the solar equator in this case (at $\sim\SI{30}{\degree}$ latitude).

    \label{fig:cme_icme_signatures}
\end{figure}

When the in situ counterparts of \acp{CME} are observed in interplanetary space, in contrast to remote sensing observations close to the Sun, they are often referred to as an interplanetary \acp{CME} \acused{ICME}(\acsp{ICME}). Common \ac{ICME} signatures include a low proton temperature and density, an enhanced and often smoothly rotating magnetic field (magnetic cloud / flux rope), bidirectional electron streaming as well as the modulation of some elemental abundance ratios \citep{Richardson-Cane-1995,Zurbuchen-2006-insitu-signatures,Wimmer-Schweingruber2006}. Examples of these signatures, mainly the low temperature and density as well as the smooth magnetic field rotation, are shown in \autoref{subfig:cme_insitu} as observed by the \ac{ACE} spacecraft --- the \ac{ICME} ejecta is located between the second and third vertical line, whose positions are taken from the list by \citet{Richardson-Cane-2010}.
As a \ac{CME}'s magnetic ejecta is often propagating at a higher velocity than the surrounding solar wind plasma, a turbulent region of compressed plasma, called the sheath, typically forms in front of these \acp{CME}. While additional solar wind plasma can be accumulated into the sheath from the front, causing it to grow over time, this effect can also be counteracted by lateral flow away from the \ac{CME} apex and magnetic reconnection with the ejecta \citep[see e.g.][]{Siscoe2008,Manchester2005,Janvier-2019}. When the \ac{CME} exceeds the local magnetosonic speed, a shock forms in front of the sheath, which is then observed as an abrupt change in most of the parameters that are measured in situ, such as the magnetic field, plasma velocity and density. This is also seen in \autoref{subfig:cme_insitu}, where the shock (first vertical line) is associated with jumps in all measured quantities and the following sheath region shows a highly compressed and turbulent plasma.

Especially since the availability of \ac{HI} observations, it has become evident that the structures observed near the Sun and in interplanetary space are directly linked. Consequently, the lines between the terms \ac{CME} and \ac{ICME} have become more blurred, and many authors have begun to use the term \ac{CME} for both the remote sensing and in situ observed phenomena.

Many efforts have been made to develop models that describe the propagation of \acp{CME} in the heliosphere and predict their arrival times at different locations, taking into account the interaction with the surrounding ambient solar wind and other interplanetary structures, such as \acp{SIR} and other \acp{CME}. Most of these models can be divided into two basic classes: \ac{MHD} simulations and empirical models. One of the most widely used \ac{MHD} models in this field is the Wang-Sheeley-Arge ENLIL with cone model (WSA-ENLIL+Cone) developed by \citet{Odstrcil-2004}. WSA-ENLIL simulates the solar wind propagation in the heliosphere based on magnetogram observations of the Sun and a potential field source surface model of the coronal magnetic field (WSA model) within \SI{21.5}{\solarradius}, which is then used as the inner boundary of the \ac{MHD} simulation (ENLIL). \acp{CME} can be injected into the \ac{MHD} model as dense cone-shaped hydrodynamic bubbles starting from the inner boundary at \SI{21.5}{\solarradius}. The input parameters, such as the \ac{CME} velocity, direction and size are typically derived manually from coronagraph observations, e.g. using the \acl{GCS}\acused{GCS} \citep[\acs{GCS},][]{Thernisien-2011-GCS} model, which is further described in \autoref{chp:GCS_Python}.

As it has long been known that the strongest geomagnetic storms are typically caused by \acp{ICME} with a strong southward magnetic field \citep[negative $B_z$, see e.g.][]{Russell-1974} and the hydrodynamic cones used in the WSA-ENLIL+Cone are just bubbles of enhanced density with no inherent magnetic field, it became clear that more sophisticated models are needed for predicting the in situ magnetic field.
Therefore, in the recent years, a new heliospheric \ac{MHD} model named the \acl{EUHFORIA}\acused{EUHFORIA} \citep[\acs{EUHFORIA},][]{Pomoell-2018} has been developed, which initially used the same cone model for describing the \acp{CME}, but was later adapted with a new \textit{spheromak} model \citep{Scolini-2019}, which includes the magnetic field of the \ac{CME} and thus has substantially improved the predictions of the magnetic field observations at Earth.

On the other hand, there are simple empirical models of \ac{CME} propagation, such as the analytical \acl{DBM}\acused{DBM} \citep[\acs{DBM},][]{Vrsnak-2013}. The \ac{DBM} is used to calculate the \ac{ICME} arrival time at different points in space, it does not predict any of the solar wind plasma or magnetic field properties. The model is based on the well-known effect that due to the interaction of \acp{CME} with the ambient solar wind, the \ac{CME} velocity $v$ tends to approach the solar wind speed $w$ over time, apparently following a ``drag force''. In reality, these forces are not caused by actual collision of particles, but transported in the form of \ac{MHD} waves and turbulence generated in the plasma \citep[see e.g.][for details]{Cargill-1996,Owens-2004}. \ac{DBM} describes the acceleration $a$ of the \ac{CME} in the mathematical form of a simple aerodynamic drag equation with an empirical drag coefficient $\Gamma$, where the solar wind speed $w$ is given as a fixed input parameter:
\begin{equation}
    a = -\Gamma (v-w) |v-w|
\end{equation}
The advantage of such a simple model is that its results are much quicker to calculate (e.g., in real time prediction environments) and it requires less input parameters. It can also be employed in a reverse modeling approach, where the model is fitted to the observed arrival times in order to determine the drag parameter \citep{Zic-2015}. Furthermore, the analytical form and fast computation time of the model allow to easily propagate the uncertainties of the input parameters, either analytically or with an ensemble modeling technique (DBEM) as proposed by \citet{Dumbovic-2018}.

As has been shown in statistical studies, e.g. by \citet{Vrsnak-2014,Dumbovic-2018} and others referenced therein, it seems that all these common modeling approaches, both empirical and \ac{MHD}, show a surprisingly similar performance when it comes to the prediction of arrival times, with a mean absolute error on the order of \SI{10}{\hour} for large representative samples of \acp{CME} arriving at Earth. Even other independent approaches such as recent studies that successfully predicted arrival times using convolutional neural networks solely based on coronagraph images (without any manual intervention for the extraction of parameters) \citep{Wang-2019} have not yet been able to significantly surpass this accuracy, even though this would be desirable for space weather forecasting purposes. This suggests that more measurements at different heliospheric locations will need to be incorporated into such models in the future --- both to provide additional input parameters from observations close to the Sun and to create a larger sample size of in situ data for better calibration of the models.

\section{Forbush decreases}
\label{sec:forbush}

\citet{Forbush-1937} and \citet{Hess-1937} first discovered short-term decreases in the \ac{GCR} intensity at Earth using ionization chambers, where decreases were detected at multiple locations simultaneously and coincided with geomagnetic storms. These decreases, which are routinely measured today using ground-based neutron monitors or spaceborne energetic particle detectors, were later named \acp{FD} in honor of their discoverer. It was found that \acp{FD} are not caused by the geomagnetic field variations themselves (as they are even observed in the polar regions), but rather have an interplanetary origin \citep[see e.g.][and references therein]{Lockwood1971}. There are two types of \acp{FD}: The so-called recurrent decreases, which are induced by \acp{CIR} and therefore reoccur after one solar rotation ($\sim$27 days), and the non-recurrent decreases caused by \acp{CME}. In both cases, the turbulent magnetic field of the shocks and sheaths associated with \acp{CME} or \acp{CIR} as well as the strong magnetic field of a \ac{CME} flux rope can shield away part of the \acp{GCR}, so that the intensity is decreased during the passage of this structure.
Especially in the case of \acp{CME}, the decrease phase is usually short ($\lesssim$ 1 day), while the recovery to the previous \ac{GCR} intensity (for isolated events) can take multiple days up to about a week. The onset typically corresponds well with the arrival of the \ac{CME} or {shock/sheath} structure. For \acp{CME} that drive a shock, a two-step decrease can sometimes be observed, with the first step caused by the shock/sheath region and the second by the magnetic ejecta --- this classical picture is illustrated by \autoref{fig:richardsoncane-cme}. However, when the resolution of the \ac{GCR} measurements is not high enough, the second step may not be clearly separable for all events associated with a shock.
\begin{figure}

	\caption[Illustration of \acsp{ICME} and \aclp{FD}]{Illustration of an \ac{ICME} that drives a shock and the \acp{FD} it causes at two locations A and B (marked by the blue dashed arrows). A classical two-step Forbush decrease is seen at location A, where both the shock/sheath and the magnetic cloud pass. A location B, only a single-step Forbush decrease is observed because only the shock is seen here. The red and pink arrows indicate selected magnetic field lines.

	\label{fig:richardsoncane-cme}
\end{figure}
Typical amplitudes of \acp{FD} can range from a few percent up to more than \SI{10}{\percent} depending on the event, but this varies significantly depending on which \ac{GCR} energies are observed: Lower energy particles are modulated more easily and thus show larger \acp{FD} \citep[e.g.][]{Lockwood1971,Lockwood1991}.

Over time, multiple models have been proposed to describe \acp{FD} caused by different magnetic structures, and these are often based on a diffusion equation. For example, the \acl{PDB}\acused{PDB} model \citep[\acs{PDB},][]{Wibberenz-1998} can be used to describe a shock that acts as a barrier through which \acp{GCR} cannot diffuse as easily as in the ambient solar wind. This creates a ``shadow'' within and behind the shock in which the \ac{GCR} intensity is decreased.
The \ac{ForbMod} developed by \citet{Dumbovic2018-ForbMod} builds on top of this approach to model \acp{FD} caused by flux rope \acp{CME} by combining the diffusion process with an expanding cylindrical flux rope structure. In this case, the flux rope initially does not contain any \acp{GCR} close to the Sun, and they can gradually diffuse into it (perpendicular to the magnetic field) over time. The time evolution of the \ac{GCR} density within the flux rope is determined by the interplay of its self-similar expansion and the efficiency of the \ac{GCR} diffusion. In a following article \citep{Dumbovic-2020-ForbMod} the model was combined with empirical equations for the energy dependence of the diffusion process, so that \acp{FD} measured using different instruments can be modeled by taking into account their response functions. \ac{ForbMod} has been applied in two of the publications included in this dissertation \citep{Forstner-2020,Forstner-2021-SolO} and further details about its derivation are given in these publications.

\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}

To better understand the propagation of \acp{ICME} in the heliosphere, their radial evolution and impacts on Earth, it is essential to make measurements not only in situ at Earth, but from as many locations as possible. This allows us to validate and calibrate modeling approaches and thus improve our forecasting capabilities. The necessary observations include both in situ measurements at different locations on the \ac{ICME}'s trajectory, e.g., as an upstream monitor on the Sun-Earth line to give early warning of an approaching \ac{ICME}, as well as remote sensing observations from viewpoints not hit by the \ac{CME} (e.g., away from the Sun-Earth line) to better understand the global \ac{CME} characteristics. Measurements at other locations also become increasingly relevant not only for Earth, but likewise for the large amount of operating and planned space missions (including human spaceflight to Mars in the next decades), which are also in need of space weather forecasting for ensuring the safety of spacecraft and astronauts.

Several spacecraft with appropriate plasma and magnetic field measurements for these purposes are already available. However, on missions not primarily focused on heliophysics, such as planetary missions, these instruments are typically absent or provide only limited data. Incorporating these missions into the framework of space weather observations would nonetheless be interesting, so that they could serve as additional in situ viewpoints. Especially in these cases, it is sensible to use \acp{FD} as an alternative method for the detection of \acp{ICME} --- these can be measured with particle detectors, which are available on many additional spacecraft. For example, the \ac{RAD} instrument on the \ac{MSL} mission, which will be introduced in \autoref{sec:mslrad}, is the only instrument that provides continuous measurements of space weather at Mars through its \ac{FD} observations --- other missions orbiting the planet such as Mars Express (2003) and \acl{MAVEN}\acused{MAVEN} (\acs{MAVEN}, 2014) carry some plasma and/or magnetic field instruments, but only have limited coverage as their orbits cross below Mars's bow shock, so that the upstream solar wind cannot be observed all the time.

This thesis will present the first systematical studies of Forbush decreases caused by \acp{ICME} at Mars using the \ac{RAD} cosmic ray data. The measured \ac{CME} arrival times at Mars as well as remote sensing data from \ac{STEREO}-\ac{HI} will be inspected to validate different approaches for the modeling of \ac{ICME} propagation (as introduced in \autoref{sec:cmes}). Furthermore, it will be explored whether it is possible to derive more information about the \ac{CME} evolution than just the arrival times from the \ac{FD} observations by applying the analytical models introduced in \autoref{sec:forbush} in a reverse modeling approach. Furthermore, some case studies of notable space weather events that were associated with \acp{FD} will be conducted.

In \autoref{chp:instruments}, a detailed overview of the most important instruments employed in these studies and their data products will be given. The following chapters present several peer-reviewed publications that study \ac{ICME} arrival times at \SI{1}{\AU} and Mars using \acp{FD} and remote sensing observations (\autoref{chp:arrival_times}) as well as additional properties of \acp{FD} at Earth and Mars and their implications for \ac{CME} radial evolution (\autoref{chp:fd_properties}). Additional articles in \autoref{chp:september_event} provide a case study of a major \ac{SEP} event at Mars in September 2017 that was associated with multiple \acp{ICME}. Moreover, the recently submitted article included in \autoref{chp:solo} shows an analysis of the first \ac{ICME} observed at the Solar Orbiter spacecraft in April 2020 and the corresponding \ac{FD} detected by its \ac{HET}. \autoref{chp:outlook} subsequently gives a summary of the studies presented in the publications. The following three appendices describe certain technical aspects of these studies in more detail, such as the derivation of response functions for the \ac{HET} (\autoref{chp:HETSimulation}) and the development of a new software implementation of the \ac{GCS} model for the reconstruction of \acp{CME} in remote sensing observations (\autoref{chp:GCS_Python}). Finally, \autoref{chp:Publicationlist} presents a list of all publications that I have contributed to, including those that are not included within this dissertation as they do not directly fit into the logical flow.
