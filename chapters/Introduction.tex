\section{Energetic particles in the heliosphere}
\label{sec:particles_heliosphere}


Our heliosphere is a vast region in space embedded in the \ac{ISM}, which encompasses all solar system planets and extends far beyond even the Kuiper belt. 
It is filled with a thin plasma consisting of various populations of particles, many of which originate from the Sun itself. These populations can be identified in \autoref{fig:heliospheric_energy_spectrum} \citep[based on measurements by][]{Mewaldt-2001}, shown as an energy spectrum that extends over more than 7 orders of 


Introduce all the particles population from lower energy to the higher energy, each population has one paragraph, according to the plot you add, and maybe one plot showed the position of multiple process, could be the plot of blue or the plot in Paddy's thesis

As shown in Fig.\ref{fig:heliospheric_energy_spectrum}, from the lower energy end to the higher energy end, we could find several different component. Solar wind, suprathermal particle, SEP, ACR, GCR. 
The shadow region indicating the energy range between few MeV to few hundreds MeV, where SEP, ACR and GCR are co-exist. 


SEP are the particle from solar, accelerated by different mechanism.
The enery range of SEP are quite broad, especially depending the on where the measurement carried on. Recently SOLO and PSP frequently measure the hundreds keV SEP.



GCR, fully ionized particlesoriginating outside the heliosphere ,accelerated ar supernova remnants [Blasi 2013], covering the energy from typical 1MeV ([Potgieter 2023 LRSP] to ZeV, 90\% of hydrogen, the remain 10\% consist of heavier ions ( percent \%), electron, positron and antiproton (?\%)
The flux , outside the heliosphere,  is isotropic distributed in space and nearly constant in time.  It is believe the source 

ACR are the high energy interstellar particles, accelerated, ionizing,. 


Both ACR and GCR's temporal variaton is highly related with the solar activities and the so-called solar modulation, which are periodcally change in 11 and 22 year period.

GCRs consist of wide range of energetic particles,  which mostly are dominated by the proton, about 89\%  and the remain share are 10\% helium and a small portal of heavier ions (1\%), electron, positron and antiproton. The dominated energy of gcr, as shown in the Fig.\ref{Fig:Oxygen_spectra_heliosphere} is above 100MeV/nuc. Below that, the other component are more common than GCR and it is hard to seperated those particles.

Figure \ref{Fig:Oxyge_spectra_cosmic_ray} are the full spectrum of the all cosmic particles observed at 1 AU which includes the ACR and GCR components.  The GCR


Currently it is believed that those GCR are main originated from the supernova explosion and derived the energy from the shock waves which is genereate from the explosion. When the shock wave travel through the surrounding interstellar gas, the kinetic energy of shock are tranfer to the  (neutral gas?) by the (Fermi-acceleration, ciataion and the acceleration process), Utilimatly, causing the galactic cosmic ray up to 10^12 eV.

Because cosmic rays are fully charged, they are deflected by the magnetic field when they propagation in the interstellar space after speeding up. The directions of those particle are normalized by the strong magnetic field. Hence when they arrived at the local bubble of solar system, we obtained an nearly isotropic and constant intensity profile [citaion of the LSTM,]


To model the solar modulation on the particle transportation of GCR spectra, an input particle spectra need to be specifield, which is the so-call LSTM [ citaion of LSTM]. LSTM is the modulation boundary and will be modulatined as the change of the position, energy, and time after those particle diffusion into the heliosphere. Such a spectra have been observed by the voyeger after then cross the boundary of solar system and enter the interstellar medium


	
A paragraph of local intersteallar spectra


After enter the heliosphere, those high energetic particle are modulated the solar wind and its embedding magnetic field  which change in a 11 year or 22 year period,
The relavant process of the solar modulations could be described by a basic transport equation (TPE) which is first derived by Parker (1965). The same equations was also derived by Gleeson and Axford (1967) in the more rigorous ways. This equation is based on the motion of charged and particle in the high frequently changed magnetic field and averages over the pitch angle of particle moving in the magnetic field. The precondition of this equation is the reasonable assumption of the isotropically distributed GCRs. The TPE give the phase-space distribution function, $f$ as the function of positions, time  and momentum magnetitude. In Potgieter (2013), the helispheric TPE, based on Parker (1965) is rewritten in the following form:

\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} = - ( V + )

\end{equation}

ACR enter the heliosphere and diffuse in the heliosphere, interacting with solar wind, and magnetic field. The transport process of ACR is similar to the GCR, which could both describe by the equation \ref{Eq:TPE}, which contain four main tranposrt effect: 

Similar to GCR, ACR flux also have solar cycle dependence, and transportation process is also the same as GCR, but the different energy particles.

	- Generation of Neutron

The exploration of space has witnessed a surge in intensity, with an increasing number of countries aspiring to venture into this domain. Noteworthy examples include NASA's initiation of the Artemis mission, which aims to return to the Moon by 2024. Similarly, China has unveiled its plans to establish a lunar base on the lunar surface by the 2030s, while the European Space Agency (ESA) has also embarked on a lunar lander mission. Most recently, a Japanese lunar lander mission was launched; however, it regrettably encountered failure.

Under these circumstances, the study of solar energetic particles (SEPs) assumes greater significance. SEPs pose a significant radiation hazard for future human exploration on the lunar surface. The most hazardous SEP events have the potential to induce radiation increases of substantial magnitude.
