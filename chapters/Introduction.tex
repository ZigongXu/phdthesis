\section{Energetic particles in the heliosphere}
\label{sec:particles_heliosphere}


Our heliosphere is a vast region in space embedded in the \ac{ISM}, which encompasses all solar system planets and extends far beyond even the Kuiper belt. 
It is filled with a thin plasma consisting of various populations of particles, many of which originate from the Sun itself. These populations can be identified in \autoref{fig:heliospheric_energy_spectrum} \citep[based on measurements by][]{Mewaldt-2001}, shown as an energy spectrum that extends over more than 7 orders of 


Introduce all the particles population from lower energy to the higher energy, each population has one paragraph, according to the plot you add, and maybe one plot showed the position of multiple process, could be the plot of blue or the plot in Paddy's thesis

As shown in Fig.\ref{Fig:heliospheric_energy_spectrum}, from the lower energy end to the higher energy end, we could find several different component. Solar wind, suprathermal particle, SEP, ACR, GCR. 
The shadow region indicating the energy range between few MeV to few hundreds MeV, where SEP, ACR and GCR are co-exist. 


SEP are the particle from solar, accelerated by different mechanism.
The enery range of SEP are quite broad, especially depending the on where the measurement carried on. Recently SOLO and PSP frequently measure the hundreds keV SEP.



GCR, fully ionized particlesoriginating outside the heliosphere ,accelerated ar supernova remnants [Blasi 2013], covering the energy from typical 1MeV ([Potgieter 2023 LRSP] to ZeV, 90\% of hydrogen, the remain 10\% consist of heavier ions ( percent \%), electron, positron and antiproton (?\%)
The flux , outside the heliosphere,  is isotropic distributed in space and nearly constant in time.  It is believe the source 

ACR are the high energy interstellar particles, accelerated, ionizing,. 


Both ACR and GCR's temporal variaton is highly related with the solar activities and the so-called solar modulation, which are periodcally change in 11 and 22 year period.

The first discovery of the galactic cosmic rays was made by the Victor Hess in 1912 when he carried on a ballon experiement. The initial purpose of the experiement was to find the source of ionizing radiation in Earth's atmosphere using the electroscope. However, as the ballon climb-up in the experiment, he found that ionization rate measured in the electroscope showed less signicant decrease than anticipated. Such a discrepancy was attributed to the existence of the cosmic rays which increase the radiation in the atmoshphere.

\acs{GCR} consist of multiple energetic particle species span a wide range of energy, which mostly are dominated by the proton, about 89\%  and the remain share are 10\% helium and a small portal of heavier ions (1\%), electron, positron and antiproton. 
It is believed that \acs{GC} are mainly originated from the supernova remanent very far from the sun[citation] and obtain the energy from the shock waves which is genereated from the explosion of supernova. When the shock wave travel through the surrounding interstellar gas, the kinetic energy of shock are tranfer to the  (neutral gas?) by the (Fermi-acceleration, ciataion and the acceleration process), Utilimatly, the energetic particle with energy up to 10$^12$ eV are created.

In figure \ref{Fig:Oxyge_spectra_cosmic_ray}, the full spectrum of the all cosmic particles observed at 1 AU which includes both the \ac{ACR} and \ac{GCR} components is shown. The \acs{GCR} are indicated as the empty squares. In the higher energy end above 1 GeV, the spectrum could be simply fitted by power a law spectrum with index of about -2.6. The knee of GCR spectra are around [] energy and reflect what mechanism[citation]. The lower energy spectra which also show as a turn over below 1 GeV are more complicated and could not be fitted by a signel power law.



% As shown in the Fig.\ref{Fig:Oxygen_spectra_heliosphere}, the dominated energy of \acs{GCR} is above 100MeV/nuc.

Because cosmic rays are fully charged, they are deflected by the magnetic field when they propagation in the interstellar space after speeding up. The directions of those particle are normalized by the strong magnetic field. Hence when they arrived at the local bubble of solar system, we obtained an nearly isotropic and constant intensity profile [citaion of the LSTM,]

To model the solar modulation on the particle transportation of GCR spectra, an input particle spectra need to be specifield, which is the so-call LSTM [ citaion of LSTM]. LSTM is the modulation boundary and will be modulatined as the change of the position, energy, and time after those particle diffusion into the heliosphere. Such a spectra have been observed by the voyeger after then cross the boundary of solar system and enter the interstellar medium


A paragraph of local intersteallar spectra ?


After enter the heliosphere, those high energetic particle are modulated the solar wind and its embedding magnetic field  which changes in a 11 year or 22 year period.
The relavant process of the solar modulations could be described by a basic transport equation (TPE) which is first derived by Parker (1965). The same equations was also derived by Gleeson and Axford (1967) in the more rigorous ways. This equation is based on the motion of charged and particle in the high frequently changed magnetic field and averages over the pitch angle of particle moving in the magnetic field. The precondition of this equation is the reasonable assumption of the isotropically distributed GCRs. The TPE give the phase-space distribution function, $f$ as the function of positions, time  and momentum magnetitude. In Potgieter (2013), the helispheric TPE, based on Parker (1965) is rewritten in the following form:

	\begin{equation}
		\underbrace{\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}}_{a} = - ( \underbrace{\boldsymbol{V}}_{b} + \underbrace{\langle v_d \rangle }_{b}) \cdot \nabla f + \underbrace{\nabla \cdot (\boldsymbol{K_s \cdot \nabla f})}_{d} + \underbrace{\frac{1}{3}(\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{V}) \frac{\partial f}{\partial ln P}}_{d}
		\label{Eq:Transportation_equation}
	\end{equation}

where $f(r, P, t)$ is the cosmic ray distribution as the function of the time t, particle rigidity P and 3-dimension position in the space. Compared with the $\sim$ 11 years solar cycle, the periodcally solar rotation ($\sim$ 27 days) and  the time of the solar wind traveling to the edge of helipshere ($\sim$ 1 years) are short-term variation and can be neglected. Hence the steady-state solution with  $\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} = 0$ (part a of Eq.\ref{Eq:Transportation_equation}) is a reasonable assumption and also considered. Terms in the right parts include four effects that are used to describe the variation of the cosmic rays: (b) convection due to the solar wind velocity $\boldsymbol{V}$; (c) drift effects caused by the gradient and curvature of the large-scale \ac{HMF}, which is estimated by a 3D Archimedean spiral (Parker 1978), $\langle v_d \rangle$ represents the averaged drift velocity; (d) diffusion effects caused by the turbulent mangetic field, with the $\boldsymbol{K}_s$ the symmetrical diffusion tenser; (e)adiabatic energy change and deceleration due to the expansion of the solar wind. 

Since TPE is a high non-linear partial differential equation, only a simplified solution of the GCR spectra is derived which is called the Force-field Solution (FFS). The FFS was first derived by Gleeson and Axford [1967, 1968b]. Later, a reasonable GCR spectra of the particle with energy above 150 MeV were given by Gleeson and Urch 1973.
With the development of computer technque and numerical studies, simulation are becoming more and more important in studying the tranporation and solar modulation of the cosmic rays. [Jokippi and Kopriva 1979, Le Roux and Potgieter 1995, Manuel et al 2011, and Potgieter 2013, Vos & Potgieter 2015, 2016; Boschini et al. 2019;
Corti et al. 2019; Shen et al. 2019 \url{https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/acbea7/pdf}]. 
Several popular used model like BON14, 2020, CREME 96 and HELMOD based the solar modulation and sunspot numbers could easily reproduce the GCR intemnsity and spectra consistent with the measurement from ACE in 1 AU and Voyager probes in the different regions of helisophere [Boschini et al 2019- Model]



GCR flux time variation - solar modulation

As ** indicating the solar minimum of SC 23/24 was quite unusual, with a much weaker \ac{HMF} compared with the history record and a higher then ever GCRn intensity. Further more, The recent solar minimum is even mroe

The exploration of space has witnessed a surge in intensity, with an increasing number of countries aspiring to venture into this domain. Noteworthy examples include NASA's initiation of the Artemis mission, which aims to return to the Moon by 2024. Similarly, China has unveiled its plans to establish a lunar base on the lunar surface by the 2030s, while the European Space Agency (ESA) has also embarked on a lunar lander mission. Most recently, a Japanese lunar lander mission was launched; however, it regrettably encountered failure.

Under these circumstances, the study of solar energetic particles (SEPs) assumes greater significance. SEPs pose a significant radiation hazard for future human exploration on the lunar surface. The most hazardous SEP events have the potential to induce radiation increases of substantial magnitude.
