\section{Particles in the heliosphere}

Our heliosphere is an enormous region in space embedded in the \ac{ISM}, which encompasses all solar system planets and extends far beyond even the Kuiper belt. 
It is filled with a thin plasma consisting of various populations of particles, many of which originate from the Sun itself (\autoref{fig:heliospheric_energy_spectrum}). 
The most abundant population is the solar wind, a steady flow of plasma that exits the Sun radially. 
In the near-Earth space, the slow solar wind reaches typical speeds between \SIrange[range-phrase={\,and\,}]{300}{500}{\kilo\meter\per\second}.
Due to its high plasma $\beta$, it carries the solar magnetic field with it and forms the \ac{IMF}.
As the Sun rotates, the \ac{IMF} carried by the solar wind is shaped like an Archimedian spiral, which is named Parker spiral after Eugene N. \citet{Parker-1958}.

However, our Sun is an active star, and thus, the flow of particles is not simply constant.
Coronal holes forming on the solar surface emit faster solar wind streams with speeds $\gtrsim \SI{600}{\kilo\meter\per\second}$, which interact with the neighboring streams of slower wind by forming a \ac{SIR}. If a coronal hole stays stable for multiple solar rotations, these interaction regions can be observed recurrently, in which case they are called \acp{CIR}.
Furthermore, active regions on the Sun can occasionally produce solar flares, sudden and intense emissions of light often associated with the release of high-energy ($\sim \si{\mega\electronvolt}$) \acp{SEP}.
These are believed to be powered by reconnection of magnetic field lines at the Sun, which leads to the release of energy and acceleration of particles.
They often also coincide with the eruption of plasma from the solar corona in the form of a \ac{CME} at speeds up to a few thousands of \si{\kilo\meter\per\second}.
Just like the solar wind, \acp{CME} carry an enhanced magnetic field with them, often in the form of a flux rope propagating away from the Sun, and due to their high speed, a shock can form in front of the flux rope, followed by a turbulent sheath region.
This shock can also be efficient at accelerating additional particles to higher energies, similar to \acp{SEP} particles accelerated directly at the Sun.

At the high end of the energy spectrum (\autoref{fig:heliospheric_energy_spectrum}) up to \si{\giga\electronvolt} energies, we find \acp{GCR}, particles originating from outside the heliosphere and entering it with a relatively constant and isotropic flux. 
The flux of these high-energy particles within the heliosphere is modulated by various effects: In the long term, the variation of the \ac{IMF} intensity during the 22-year solar cycle causes the average GCR flux to be higher during solar minimum than at solar maximum. In addition, there can be short-term modulations of \ac{GCR} due to magnetic structures in the solar wind, such as \acp{CME} and \acp{SIR}/\acp{CIR}. In the case of observations that are not made in deep space, but on the surface of Earth or other planets, the atmosphere and magnetosphere of this planet also modulates the observed \ac{GCR} spectrum, e.g. by shielding away lower energy particles.

\section{Space Weather events and their detection}

As defined by the U.S. National Space Weather Program \parencite{OFCM-1995}, the term \textit{space weather} refers to ``conditions on the Sun and in the solar wind, magnetosphere, ionosphere and thermosphere that can influence the performance and reliability of space-borne and ground-based technological systems and endanger human life or health''.
The aforementioned short-term heliospheric events, such as \acp{SEP}, \acp{CME} and \acp{CIR} are all relevant to space weather science, as both the increased energetic particle radiation as well as the magnetic field disturbances (e.g. to the Earth's magnetosphere) can have such impacts on technology or human life.
Thus, the focus in space weather research is to enhance the understanding of these events in order to be able to more accurately predict their occurrence, including the onset time and intensity.
In the past, the development of such models has been mostly based on two kinds of measuremets: Remote-sensing observations of the Sun and its vicinity, such as EUV images, magnetograms and white-light coronagraphs, and in situ observations at or near Earth, using ground-based neutron monitors or energetic particle detectors, plasma measurements and magnetometers on spacecraft orbiting Earth (e.g., IMP-8, GOES) or at the $L_1$ Lagrange point (ACE, SOHO, WIND, DSCOVR).
In the last two decades, such observations have been complemented by in situ measurements from deep space heliophysics missions, such as from the two STEREO spacecraft orbiting the Sun near \SI{1}{\AU} as well as the recent Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar Orbiter (SolO) missions, which will provide valuable data from extremely close to the Sun. Additionally these missions provide imaging observations from additional vantage points, and these do not only cover the Sun and the corona, but also provide a wide-angle view of interplanetary space using their heliospheric imagers (HI), which can be used to directly track \acp{CME} all the way out to Earth.
