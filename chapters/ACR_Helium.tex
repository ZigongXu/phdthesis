At the end of section~\ref{chp:SOLO_Quite_time}, \citet{Mason-2021-SolOQuietTime} reported the radial gradient of \ac{ACR} oxygen and helium-4 with energies of 4.4 MeV/nuc within 1 au. The analysis was based on the measurements from the \ac{SIS} instrument in 2020, and particle intensities were plotted as a function of three radial locations. Due to limited counting numbers, the flux uncertainties of flux were relatively large. However, the results still indicate a positive and small gradient for oxygen compared to the observations from Helios and \ac{PSP} \citep{Rankin2021ApJ,Marquardt2018AA}.

As of 2023, the changing solar activities and the solar modulations have also influenced \acp{ACR} in the inner heliosphere as they propagate inward and diffuse throughout the heliosphere. Those changes are reflected in the variation of \ac{ACR} intensities and potentially in that of the radial gradient.
Meanwhile, the \ac{SolO} has completed its fifth orbit and continues its journey in the inner heliosphere. The \ac{HET} on board the \ac{SolO} has been measuring helium of tens of MeV/nuc during the last two years witnessed the change of solar activities and solar modulations.

Therefore, in this chapter, we investigate new \acp{ACR} observations in the inner heliosphere and in the new solar cycle, utilizing new data from the \ac{HET} on board \ac{SolO}. We present the spectra and radial gradient of \ac{ACR} helium in the inner heliosphere between 2020 and 2022, taking into account possible interuptions such \acp{SEP}, periodically occurring \ac{CIR} and long-term solar modulation. Moreover, we use helium flux measurements from the \ac{EPHIN} on board \ac{SOHO} to derive the flux ratio between \ac{SolO} and \ac{SOHO}/\ac{EPHIN}. By so, we remove the effect of solar modulation. Preliminary results indicate consistency between \ac{HET} and \ac{EPHIN}, and the radial gradient of helium-4 aligns closely with previous results from \ac{PSP}, considering the uncertainties. The variation of the helium radial gradient is also discussed in the early phase of solar cycle 25.

The details of the data analysis and results are given below. Noting that results are still in the preliminary phase. We will continue analyzing the data and preparing the final publication, which will be submited to Astronomy and Astrophysics in the near future.


\section{Background}

The \ac{ACR} are the energetic ionized neutrals that are widespread in the heliosphere and are predominant in the energy range of tens of MeV/nuc. The source of \ac{ACR} is believed to be the blunt temination shock located at the boundary of heliosphere \citep{McComas2006GeoRL}. Since the \ac{ACR} was first discovery in 1970, scientists have confirmed the observations of \ac{ACR} helium, oxygen, neon, and also protons in the outer heliosphere. \citep{Garcia1973ICRC,Hoverstadt1973PhRvL,McDonald1974ApJ,Potgieter2013LRSP}

Generally, the transport of the cosmic rays in the heliosphere are described by the interaction between charged particles and the solar wind as well as its embedding large scale solar magnetic field. The different physical processes that affection the propagation of particles are (a) diffusion caused by the irregular magnetic field, (b) adabitic energy loss and convection due to the expanding solar wind, and (c) gradient and curature drift leaded by the heliospheric magnetic field
Though the cosmic ray transport equation have generally described and modeled those basic processes \citep{Parker1965Pss,Jokipii1977ApJ,Jokipii1981ApJ,McDonald2001ICRC}, the detailed roles of each components in the inner heliosphere and how the new measurement affected by the varying solar magnetic field are still not fully understood \citep{Rankin2021ApJ}.

In particular, spatial gradients provide valuable insights into the variation of drift effect of charged particle through consecutive solar cycle. As elucidated by \citet{Jokipii1977ApJ, Jokipii1979ApJ, Potgieter2013LRSP}, the drift direction of energetic particles differs during opposite solar polarities, which alternate approximately every 11 years, resulting in the form of a 22-year variation. Considering the recent solar activity minimum in 2020 as an example, the solar magnetic field exhibits positive polarity. Consequencely, the positively charged ions drift inward from the south and north pole regions, while moving outward along the equatorial plane through the current sheet. Conversely, during the opposite polarity, ions drift inward from the equator and exit through the poles. Noting that the drift direction of electrons is opposite to that of ions. The drift effects are manifested in spatial gradients. Previous observtions from Voyager and Pioneer missions have indicated that the latitudinal gradient changes sign between two consecutive solar cycles belonging to different polarities, in agreement with predictions from tranport models \citep{Mckibben1979ApJ, Cummings1987GeoRL, Christon1986JGR}. Moreover, the magnitude of the radial gradient varies between between different polarity solar cycles \citep{Rankin2021ApJ,Rankin2022ApJ,Giacalone2022SSRv,Webber1981JGR,Marsden1999AdSpR}.

%Despite of this, the precious radial gradient of the current solar cycle especially during the ininial phase of the new solar cycle are not measured and determined.
Acoording to \citet{Rankin2021ApJ}, the radial gradient of cosmic rays could be express as:
\begin{equation}
    g_r = \frac{1}{f}\frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{r}} = \frac{\partial{\mathrm{ln} f}}{\partial{r}}
    \label{eq:radial_gradient}
\end{equation}
Where $g_r$ denotes the differential radial gradient component under the assumption that the latitude gradient is negligible. It represents the change of the differentila flux, $f$ with respect to radial distance $r$. The radial gradient can be obtained by fitting the data to a linear equation using the least square method.


Benefiting from its unique orbit, with a cloest perihelion distance of 0.28 au, \ac{SolO}, launched on 2020, provides valuabel insights into the transport effects of the cosmic rays in the inner heliosphere by measuring the radial gradient of those particles.
In Fig.~\ref{fig:SOLO_orbit_info}, we present the orbit information of \ac{SolO} from Feb 2020 to May 2023. The top three panels display the radial distance to the Sun, Carrington longtitude and Carrrigton latitude of \ac{SolO}. As depicted in the top panel, \ac{SolO} has completed five orbits and is moving away from the Sun after passing its sixth perihelion. The closest distance to the Sun was achived during the fifth oribt in September of 2022. 
The carrington longititude of \ac{SolO} indicates its movement relative to a fixed longitude line on the Sun. Originally defined from the Earth's perspective, with a mean synodic period of approximately 27.2753 days, the Carrington system and its origin point are adapted to the \ac{SolO} coordinate system. 
Due to the greatly varying radius of the orbit, orbital periods of \ac{SolO} carrington rotations range between 26.6 and 35.8 days, slight differing from the period of the Earth. At the moment, the latitude of \ac{SolO} is constrained within a range of $\sim$ $\pm$8 degrees.
Additionally, we provide the radial distance and the longitudinal seperation between \ac{SolO} and Earth to illustrate the relative positions.

To better visualize and understand \ac{SolO}'s movement in the inner heliosphere and its relation to the Sun and Earth, we depict the orbit track of \ac{SolO} in two coordinate systems in Fig.~\ref{fig:SOLO_orbit_track}. The left panel shows the orbit in helioscentric ecliptic coordinate system, where the mean equinox are used as the reference direction of x axis. In this coordinate system, \ac{SolO}'s orbit exhibits an elliptical shape. Similarly, the right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:SOLO_orbit_track} presetnt the orbit in a heliosgraphic coordinate system, with the Sun fixed in the the central and the Earth positioned at 1 au as blue dot. The x-axis is aligned the Sun - Earth direction. In this coordinate system, orbits appear twisted and undergoes changes in shape.

The color bars in both panels indicate the time sequence from February 2020 to May 2023. Carrington rotation numbers are marked at the beginning of each Carrington cycle and labeled next to the orbit track. The moving direction of spacecraft can been inferred from changes the numbers and colors.
%Obviously, when the spacecraft is located away the sun, the \ac{SolO} is moving in a limited region, with hardly changed longtitude in one carrington rotation. Conversely, the longitudinal changes are large when \ac{SolO} rapidly pass by the sun. Between them the radial distance change quickly. 


%In this report, we organized the content as following: We first introduce the data and instrument we used in this work, which including the SOLO/HET, SOHO/EPHIN, STEREO/LET and possiblely LND. In chapter 3 we give the overview of the observation of the helium-4 between 2020 and 2022 when in the second half, SEPs frequently happens and the overall cross-calibration between different instrument

%In section4, we explain the several kind of effect that could disturbe the constanct background and show how the result are affected by different method.  In the end, we conclude.

\section{Instrument}


The charged particles reported in this study are mainly from \ac{HET} onboard \ac{SolO} which measures ions in the energy range from tens of MeV/nuc to hundred MeV/nuc. Specifically, we focus on helium particles within the energy range of 10 - 50 MeV/nuc, where the predominant particles are \acp{ACR} during the quiet time. Further details regarding the \ac{HET} measurement principle can be found in section \ref{sec:Solar_Orbiter} and \citet{RodriguezPacheco-2019-EPD}.

Similar to the analysis by \citet{Mason-2021-SolOQuietTime} for the \ac{SIS}, our analysis of the helium radial gradients measured \ac{HET} is also constrained by their counting statistics due to limited \ac{HET} geometry factors and lower helium intensities. To increase the count rate and reduce uncertainties, we employ two measures. First, we calculate a summation of the data collected from different instrument directions. \ac{HET} has four apertures pointing to sunward, anti-sunward, southward, and northward directions. Assuming the isotropic distribution of \acp{ACR}, the summation of particles from different directions reduces the uncertainties by half. Furthermore, we extend the energy bins of the \ac{HET} nominal data product and reconstruct the energy channels for particle stopping in detector C, covering the energy range of 10 - 20 MeV/nuc, 20 - 30 Mev/nuc, 30 - 40 Mev/nuc, 40 - 50 Mev/nuc. The specific boundaries of those bins are determined based on energy channels' values of nominal data products.

In addition to nominal data products designed to provide scientific measurements with high energy resolution and precious intensity, we utilize housekeeping data to identify the \ac{SEP} periods. This housekeeping data register particles that coincidently trigger two \acp{SSD}. Therefore this counter has more significant counting statistics than the nominal scientific data product (see Fig.~\ref{Fig:solo-lvl2}), making that housekeeping data an ideal indicator of solar activities and \ac{SEP} events. 

%This trigger can detect energetic electrons, protons, and heavy ions without any element resolution, 
%The periods are determined by the 3-sigma method \citep{Xu2017ApJ,Xu2020ApJ, Huttunen2005AA}, which is commonly used in determining the onset time of the \ac{SEP} event. In this method, if intensities of data points are about 3 time of standard devitaion higher than the background intensity, these data points are defined as the \ac{SEP}.


Apart from \ac{HET}, we also utilized other observations for comparison purposes, including \ac{SOHO}/\ac{EPHIN}, the \ac{ACESIS} and the \ac{CRIS} onboard the \ac{ACE}, and the \ac{LND} on the lunar far-side surface. The measurements from \ac{ACE}/\ac{ACESIS} are taken as the baseline when considering the long-term trend of cosmic rays. 

\section{Overview observations between 2020 and 2022 and the cross calibration between four instruments}

\subsubsection*{Spectra comparison between \ac{HET} and other instruments}
%\addtocontents{toc}{\protect\setcounter{tocdepth}{1}}
%%%%%% review to here.
Before deriving radial gradients of helium, it is necessary to provide an overview of the \ac{HET} observations of heavier ions, such as helium, carbons, nitrogens, and oxygens. Fig.~\ref{fig:overview} illustrate the averaged spectra between 2020 and 2022 after removing the possible \ac{SEP} periods, which are determined below and can be found in Appendix \ref{Appendix:SEPlist}.


The \ac{HET} measurements are represented by diamonds of various colors, with red for helium-4, blue for oxygens, orange for carbons, and green for nitrogens.
The helium spectrum spans over a wide energy range, consist of particles stopping in detector B ($<$ 10 Mev/nuc), stopping in detector C (10 - 100 MeV/nuc) and penetrating particles ($>$ 100 MeV/nuc). 
However, for the analysis of \ac{ACR} helium radial gradients, only helium stopping in detector C will be used.
%The penetrating helium comprises two populations depending on their primary energy: the barely penetrating helium marked as empty red diamonds and the fully penetrating particle with energy above 200 MeV/nuc. 
%%% here  ----
Althougt they will not be used later, it is stil worth noting that penetrating data products may exhibit certain issues. 
Firstly, the intensity measured by two channels around 100 MeV/nuc are few times higher than the nearby channels. These abnormal increases have not been corrected.
%probably due to the dead layer in front of each detectors \citep{Wimmer2021AA}. It also possible that the energy channels have not been properly calibrated.
Besides, when converting counts to fluxes in the \ac{GCR} spectrum, geometry factors of fully penetrating particles channels, i.e., the last three channels, should be calculated based on a 4$\pi$ simulation rather than the current 2$\pi$ simulation, which is suitable for highly anisotropic \acp{SEP}.


In Fig.~\ref{fig:overview}, \ac{ACE} measurements are plotted as circles, including filled circles representing \ac{ACESIS} and empty ones for \ac{CRIS}. Unfortunately, at the moment, helium measurements from \ac{ACE} are available below 15 MeV/nuc. Hence we use helium data from \ac{SOHO}/\ac{EPHIN} which are shown as the purple squares, to calculate radial gradients of \ac{ACR} helium. Besides, \ac{LND} measured helium-4 are also shown as brown triangles. \ac{EPHIN} covers the \ac{ACR} energy range of 10 - 50 MeV/nuc while \ac{LND} covers the energy range of 10 - 35 MeV/nuc.

Fig.~\ref{fig:overview} reveals a general agreement of averaged spectra of four particle species, though measurements come from different instruments and distinct positions. Furthermore, the flat helium spectra between 10 MeV - 50 MeV/nuc and the peak intensity of oxygen and nitrogen at 10 MeV/nuc demonstrate the presence of the \ac{ACR} components in the inner heliosphere. 

Fig.~\ref{fig:helium_spec_1au} focuses on the helium-4 spectra based on the measurement when \ac{SolO} was positioned between 0.95 and 1 au. The periods when \ac{SolO} was close to 1 au in the last two years are given in Tabel \ref{tab:1AU_period}, which consists of start times, end times, and the relative distance from \ac{SolO} to the Earth.
Similarly, the averaged spectrum of \ac{EPHIN} and \ac{HET} helium in the energy above 10 MeV/nuc are consistent. Therefore we utilize the \ac{EPHIN} and \ac{HET} helium measurement within the energy range of 10 to 50 MeV/nuc in the susequent analysis.
The discrepancy of spectra appears on energy channels below 10 Mev where intensities of \ac{ACESIS} and \ac{HET} are about two times higher than that of \ac{EPHIN}. Besides, the \ac{LND} spectrum appears generally higher than the other measurements and has larger error bars. The more significant uncertainties are due to the limited operation time on the lunar surface (see section \ref{sec:change_4_LND}).

    \label{fig:overview_helium_intensity}
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:overview_helium_intensity} presents intensity profiles of helium from Feburary 2020 to October 2022 from \ac{HET}, \ac{EPHIN}, \ac{LND} and \ac{STEREO}-A. The energy ranges of reconstructed channels are labeled in legends correspondingly. The bottom panel shows the variation of \ac{SolO} orbit distance.


Figure~\ref{fig:overview_helium_intensity} clearly shows that helium fluxes are relatively stable from 2020 to the middle of 2021. Most helium is the background cosmic rays; only one large \ac{SEP} event occurred at the end of 2020 \cite{Kolhoff2021AA}. 
Since the second half of 2021, more \acp{SEP} are emitted from the Sun and measured by different instruments, especially \ac{HET} and \ac{EPHIN}, as shown in the top two panels of Fig.~\ref{fig:overview_helium_intensity}.
Those large and intense \acp{SEP} significantly disturb the time profile of the \ac{ACR} background and, consequently, must be removed before we calculate the \ac{ACR} radial gradient. 
Of note, the energetic helium arrives differently at \ac{SolO}, \ac{EPHIN}, and \ac{STEREO}-A. The discontinuities of \ac{LND} measurements are due to the hibernation of \ac{LND} during the local night on the Moon's far-side surface.


In addition to the intermittent occurring \ac{SEP}, the long-term decrease is also clearly shown in the \ac{SolO} and \ac{EPHIN} time profiles from 2020 to the end of 2022. Such a decrease is because of the enhanced solar modulation, which significantly reduces the number of \acp{ACR} arriving at the Earth and the inner heliosphere below one au. We could foresee a further decrease of the \ac{ACR} intensity in the next few years before the solar activity reaches the maximum.

In contrast to the transient variation from \ac{SEP} and 11-year variation attributed to large-scale solar modulation, the intensities of cosmic rays are additionally influenced and modulated by recurring, compressed structures that are formed from the interaction between fast and slow solar wind stream emitted from the solar surface. There compressed structures, known as stream interaction regions or corotating interaction regions, periodically enhance the pressure and density of the plasma and corotate with the Sun for approximately 27 days, aligned with the Sun's rotation \citep{Burlaga1974JGR, Gosling1976JGR, Richardson2004SSRv}. Those changes in local conditions modify the transport of cosmic rays, resulting in decreases of the intensity of the order of 1 - 5 \% \citep{}, though they are not as significant as those due to \acp{SEP} and solar modulations.

\section{Averaged helium intensity profile}
\subsection*{Solar energetic particle events list}

As previously mentioned, \ac{SEP} events significantly disturb the \ac{ACR} background. Therefore, it is crucial to have a completed and properly defined \ac{SEP} periods. This section describes the methodology and data products we used to determine the \ac{SEP} periods. The \ac{SEP} lists are determined separately for each case since \acp{SEP} arrived differently at \ac{SolO} and at the Earth. 

To thoroughly remove solar particles and mitigate the presence of residual particles that may not be directly recognized from intensity profiles, we use different data products to identify \acp{SEP} rather than relying solely on helium data.

The housekeeping data of \ac{HET}, specifically the HET\_any(a1, b1i) and HET\_any(a2, b2i) channels are employed to determine \ac{SEP} periods for observations from \ac{SolO}. 
These housekeeping data represent the coincident measurements of particle using the \acp{SSD}. Among them, HET\_any(a1, b1i) corresponds to particle detected by the sunward telescope, while HET\_any(a2, b2i) corresponds to particles detected by the anti-sunward telescope. Those channels have larger counting statistics, ranging from approximately 600 to 800 per hour. Since the profile of both case are similar, we only use the sunward measurement for the determination of \ac{SEP} periods. 
For \acp{SEP} reaching the Earth, we utilize the time profile of proton in the energy range below 10 MeV observed by \ac{EPHIN} to determined \acp{SEP}. 
Fig.~\ref{Fig:solo-lvl2} presents the 1-hour count rate of housekeeping data, while the proton profiles are displayed in Fig.~\ref{Fig:SOHO_EPHIN_Proton_flux}

The durations of \ac{SEP} events are determined using the 3-$\sigma$ method, supplemented by eye inspection. Here, $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of background measurements taken during pre-event quiet periods. \ac{SEP} periods are defined as consecutive time intervals when the flux exceeds three times the standard deviation above the background. This method is commonly used to determine the onset time of \ac{SEP} events and is valid for those \acp{SEP} with clear onset and sharp increase.

However, if the background is unclear and the increase of the temporal profiles is slow, the determination of the onset and end of the event might have a larger uncertainty. In this case, we check the results manually and determine the boundaries of periods by eye.

As a result, the \ac{SEP} periods that we determined are illustrated as the magenta-colored region in Fig.~\ref{Fig:solo-lvl2} and Fig.~\ref{Fig:SOHO_EPHIN_Proton_flux}. The \ac{SEP} periods are listed in Tables.~\ref{tab:solo_SEPlist} and \ref{tab:SOHO_SEP_list} in Appendix \ref{Appendix:SEPlist}

\subsection*{Averaged over Carrington rotation}

As mentioned earlier, transient \acp{SEP}, long-term solar modulation, and periodic \ac{CIR} and \ac{SIR} affect the \ac{ACR} intensity. In the previous section, we identified and removed \ac{SEP} periods to obtain a slowly changing profile. In this section, we will further reduce the impact of recurring compressed regions by averaging the intensity profile over the Carrington rotation, as suggested by \citep{Rankin2021ApJ}. The Carrington rotations are defined in the second panel from the top in Fig.~\ref{fig:SOLO_orbit_info} which depicts the change of \ac{SolO}'s Carrington longitude. 

%. Though that data point is from a Carrington rotation with a larger \ac{SEP} event, we have already removed the \ac{SEP} periods from the data. Besides, such an increase is even clearer in the higher energy channel (bottom panel). 

Fig.~\ref{fig:carrington_flux} displays the average helium flux from \ac{HET} (orange line) and \ac{EPHIN} (blue line). The red dashed lines indicate the variation in radial distance between \ac{SolO} and the Sun. The averaged flux decreases over time which is significant. The measurements show overall consistency across all four channels, despite the anticipated radial gradient of approximately 25\%/au \citep{Rankin2021ApJ}.

However, we could still see some discrepancies that is worth noting. During the end of 2020 and the start of 2021, the \ac{HET} helium intensity is unusually higher than that of \ac{EPHIN}. The discrepancies are up to 30 \% and are clearly seen in four channels.

Furthermore, the bottom panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:carrington_flux} shows that before 2021, the intensities of 40 - 50 MeV/nuc helium from \ac{EPHIN} are statistically lower than that from \ac{HET}. After that, such a discrepancy gradually disappeared in this channel. Besides, such a discrepancy is unseen in the lower energy channels. Currently, the reasons for these discrepancies are unclear.

Fig.~\ref{fig:fluxvsdistance} illustrates the variation in helium flux within the energy range of 10 - 20 MeV/nuc from \ac{HET}, as a function of the radial distance from 0.4 to 1 au. Averaged fluxes of four orbits are represented by distinct colors, as indicated in the legends. Additionally, blue triangles that overlay solid circles suggest the time order of measurements. Notably, the intensity of helium at the last measurement point is about five times less than that at the beginning. Without carefully tackling this underlying basedline trend, we could not derive the radial gradient with a magnitude of $\sim$ 25\%/au.

\section{Radial gradient of ACR helium}

Deriving the limited radial gradient from the substantially changed data is challenging, particularly when dealing with the five-fold decrease in helium intensity resulting from solar modulation.
To address this challenge and obtain the radial gradient, we detrend the \ac{HET} flux by using the \ac{EPHIN} flux as a baseline. We assume that solar modulation is the same for both instruments. We first calculate the ratio of \ac{HET} and \ac{EPHIN} and then estimate the radial gradient of different energy \ac{ACR} helium using the definition in Eq.~\ref{eq:radial_gradient}.

We present the temporal variation of flux ratio between \ac{HET} and \ac{EPHIN} for four energy channels in the first and third rows of Fig.~\ref{fig:ratio_radialgradient}. The various colored regions represent periods of different orbits. The second and fourth rows illustrate the ratio in log scale as a function of the radial distance. Here, only the data points from of first three orbits are shown and fitted. That is because \acp{SEP} are the dominant particles in the fourth orbit. Hence most of the data are removed, causing more considerable uncertainties in the result. The colored dashed lines in the figure represent the fitting results obtained for different orbits. The shaded regions surrounding these lines are the corresponding 95\% confidence intervals,  indicating the uncertainty of the fitting results. The averaged radial gradients of the first three orbits are depicted as black dashed lines, indicating the overall trend between 2020 and 2022.
In addition, we have summarized the radial gradient of \ac{ACR} helium in different energy channels and for different orbits in Table~\ref{Tab:radialgradient_1}.

\subsection*{Radial gradient of helium VS energy}


Fig.~\ref{fig:comparison_SOLO_PSP} displays the energy dependency of the radial gradient of \ac{ACR} helium measured by \ac{PSP} and \ac{SolO}. 
Despite the large uncertainties, radial gradients of heliums measured by \ac{SolO} averaged over the first three orbits are shown as orange diamonds. Except for helium in the energy range of 30 - 40 MeV/nuc, which has a lower average gradient of 10 $\pm$ 11 \% /au, we report radial gradients of 28$\pm$ 8 \%/au, 19$\pm$ 8 \%/au, and 21$\pm$ 11 \%/au for helium energies of 10 - 20 MeV/nuc, 20 - 30 MeV/nuc and 40 - 50 MeV/nuc respectively.
Such gradients are consistent with \ac{PSP}'s results within the uncertainties.
To compare with \ac{PSP} results derived by \citet{Rankin2021ApJ}, we replot helium radial gradients as the blue circles at their energy range. \ac{PSP} measurements are from 2018 to 2019 in the same solar activity minimum but earlier than \ac{SolO}. The averaged radial gradient of helium in the energy range of 4 - 45 MeVn/nuc is about 25$\pm$5 \%/au.

\subsection*{The time variation of the radial gradient}

We also present the time variation of the helium radial gradients for different energy ranges from 10 - 50 MeV/nuc in Fig.~\ref{fig:radialgradient_time_variation}. The behaviors exhibited by the different energy channels are distinct, and the radial gradients show significant variations from 2020 to 2022, probably due to increased solar activity. Several intriguing features are observed in the time variation of the radial gradients, which are unexpected and hard to explain.

The peaks of radial gradients occur at different times for each energy channel. The highest radial gradient for the 10 - 20 Mev/nuc helium channel appears during the second orbit, while for the 30 - 50 Mev/nuc channels, the peaked gradients are observed in the subsequent orbit.

Furthermore, the sign of the radial gradient in the energy range of 10 - 20 MeV/nuc changes from positive to negative during the fourth orbit in 2022. This change could be attributed to the more considerable uncertainties introduced by \acp{SEP}. Because of the more frequently appeared \ac{SEP}, we might remove most of the data from \ac{EPHIN} measurements in one Carrington rotation, thus the few days' measurements could not represent the whole Carrington rotation. Consequently, the Carrington averaged \ac{EPHIN} flux in the fourth orbit exhibit more fluctuations than the previous periods. 
An alternative explanation for the observed sign change in the radial gradient could be attributed to the complex magnetic field structures in the inner heliosphere governed by the Sun and solar activities. 
For instance, near the Sun, the radial components are overwhelmed by the transverse magnetic fluctuations \citep{Rankin2022ApJ} in the inner heliosphere, causing a different transport environment than the outer heliosphere. 
On the other hand, with the Sun becoming more active than before, the large-scale \ac{HMF} might also be distorted by transient eruptions such as \acp{CME}.

%From the averaged intensity we could find that the averaged helium flux from \ac{EPHIN} changed drastically between the consecutive carrington rotation. Unlike the similar change in the previous orbit, such change is due to the

\section{ Summary and discussion}

We presented the \ac{ACR} helium in the energy range of 10 - 50MeV/nuc, measured by \ac{SolO}/\ac{HET} between Feb 2020 and Sep 2022. During this period, the first half was still the solar activity minimum 24/25 characterized by minimal solar activities, while the second half witnessed an increasing number of \acp{SEP}.
Comparisons between the helium spectra obtained by \ac{HET}, \ac{EPHIN}, and \ac{ACE}/\ac{ACESIS} show general agreement. Furthermore, \ac{SolO} and \ac{ACE} exhibit consistent measurements of carbons, oxygens, and nitrogens.

By utilizing the \ac{EPHIN} measurement as the baseline, we derive the radial gradient of \ac{ACR} helium in the inner heliosphere. We reduce the effect of long-term solar modulation by dividing the intensity of  \ac{HET} by that of \ac{EPHIN} 
after we remove the interference by \acp{SEP} and the potential short-term variations due to \acp{CIR}.
We report that the radial gradients for helium energies of 10 - 20 MeV/nuc, 20 - 30 MeV/nuc, and 40 - 50 MeV/nuc are 28$\pm$ 8 \%/au, 19$\pm$ 8 \%/au, and 21$\pm$ 11 \%/au respectively. 
These results are consistent with gradients obtained by \ac{PSP} within the uncertainty. Interestingly, the averaged radial gradient in the energy range of 30 - 40 MeV/nuc is only half that in the other channels, about 10 $\pm$ 11 \%/au. Currently, those results are very preliminary, and more discussions are needed to improve the results and explain this feature.

The analysis above shows how challenging it is to derive the radial gradient of \ac{ACR} helium. In addition to the intensity decrease caused by the long-term solar modulation, the more troubled component is the remanent \acp{SEP} that could not be recognized from the time series of the proton flux from \ac{EPHIN} and the L2 trigger rate of \ac{HET}. Here we proposed another two different methods to derive cleaner \ac{ACR} measurements.

The first method sets a threshold for the particle intensity that will be used to calculate the averaged flux. By doing so, the data points of intensity higher than the threshold will be filtered out. In practice, we chose the threshold of 95 \% of particles. This method is under the assumption that the highest intensity particles are from \acp{SEP} that we could not identify. As a result, the radial gradients with this extra mask are consistent with the gradients we obtained above. We derive the gradients of 27 $\pm$ 7 \%/au , 16 $\pm$ 8 \%/au and 21$\pm$ 11 \%/au for helium energies of 10 - 20 MeV/nuc, 20 - 30 MeV/nuc and 40 - 50 MeV/nuc, respectively. 


Due to the high time resolution and limited \ac{FOV} of \ac{HET} data products, the count rates of helium measurements are discrete values and, most of the time, are zeros, as the data show. The distribution of the count rate should be described by a Poisson distribution with a parameter $\lambda$ equal to the mean values. 
The second method assumes that the \ac{ACR} background, that is unaffected by any modulation effects, has constant intensity during a certain period, for instance, one day. A mean value could represent the measurements of this background. However, when the background is interrupted by a short-time structure, regardless of wheterh it causes the flux to increase or decrease, the Poisson distribution with mean values as $\lambda$ can not model the count rate distribution. Note that this method is only applied to disentangle short interval change. 
In practice, firstly, we calculate the mean value during one day. Later, we check how likely the measurements follow the Poisson distribution with the $\lambda$ equals to the mean value.
By doing so, we obtain the same table as in Table \ref{Tab:radialgradient_1}, and the new results are given below in Table \ref{Tab:radialgradient_2}.
The averaged gradients over the first three orbits are 34 $\pm$ 8 , 22 $\pm$ 10, 19$\pm$ 11 for helium energies of 10 - 20 MeV/nuc, 20 - 30 MeV/nuc, and 40 - 50 MeV/nuc, respectively. 


We realized that some other methods could also be used to derive the radial gradient of \ac{ACR} helium in the future. For instance, we could use the median value rather than the mean value to represent the flux of the center Carrington rotation. The purpose of this method is that median values are less affected by outliers. Hence we could avoid the higher energy tails, if there are any, after we remove \acp{SEP} showed before. Besides, we could also use the daily averaged flux rather than the mean value of a full Carrington rotation to calculate the ratio between \ac{HET} and \ac{EPHIN}. 


Furthermore, as discussed in \citet{Rankin2021ApJ}, the \ac{GCR}helium should also be considered in the energy range of 10 - 50 MeV/nuc. According to the spectra predicted from the simulation, the \ac{GCR} helium intensity increases with the energy increases before it peaks. \citet{Rankin2021ApJ} found that after subtract the assumed \ac{GCR} intensity, the raidal gradient become larger. Therefore, we will also consider this correction in future work once we find a better way to estimate the varying \ac{GCR} helium intensity.

Here, we just present the result of our analysis for the radial gradient without given any detailed explainations. Nevertheless, linking our current observations to the previous results and our present knowledge of the cosmic ray transport will significantly advance our understanding of the \ac{ACR} transport in the inner heliosphere.
%Finally, we have averaged the helium intensity over a complete carringon rotation to remove the potential \ac{CIR} modulation effect. Howvever, e \ac{CIR} modulation might need to be further considered,
