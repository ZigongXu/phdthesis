\section{Introduction}

In the end of section ~\ref{chp:SOLO_Quite_time}, \citet{Mason-2021-SolOQuietTime} reports the radial gradient of \ac{ACR} oxygen and helium-4 with energy of 4.4 MeV/nuc inside 1 au. The results are based on the measurement in 2020 and the intensities of particle are plotted as a function of three radial gradients. Though the relative larger uncertainty which is due to the limited count number, the results suggest a positive and small oxygen gradient, compared with the observation from Helios and \ac{PSP} \citep{Rankin2021ApJ,Marquardt2018AA}.

As of 2023, \ac{SolO} has finished its fifth orbit and continues its trip in the inner heliosphere and \ac{EPD} provides more measurements for the study of \ac{ACR} radial gradient of \ac{ACR}. 
In this chapter, we will employ the new data from \ac{HET} onboard \ac{SolO} and present the first observation of the \ac{ACR} heliums in the inner heliosphere between 2020 and 2022. Possible interuptions including \acp{SEP}, periodically appeared compression regions and the long term solar modulation are properly considered. Moreover, the helium flux measured by \ac{EPHIN} onboard \ac{SOHO} is utilized to derive the ratio of \ac{SolO} and \ac{SOHO}/\ac{EPHIN} in order to remove the effect of solar modulation. Our preliminary results show that \ac{SolO} and \ac{SOHO}/\ac{EPHIN} are consistent with each other and the radial gradient of helium-4 is closed to the previous results determined by \ac{PSP}, considering the uncertainty.

The details of the data analysis and summary of the results are given below, although some results are still in the preliminary phase. We will continue the data analysis and the final version of the paper is in preparation and to be submited to Astronomy and Astrophysics.


\section{Background}

The \ac{ACR} are the energetic ionized neutrals that widely exist in the heliosphere and dominated the energy of tens of MeV/nuc. The source of \ac{ACR} is believe to be the blunt temination shock located at the boundary of heliosphere.[\citation]. Since the \ac{ACR} was first discovery in 1970, scientists have confirmed the observations of \ac{ACR} helium, oxygen, neon, and also protons in the outer heliosphere. 

The transport of those cosmic ray in the heliosphere is still an unsolved question. When traveling inward, the cosmic rays get modulated by the solar wind and the embedding large scale solar magnetic field. The interactions that affection the propagation of particles in the heliosphere include (a) diffusion caused by the irregular magnetic field, (b) adabitic energy loss and convection due to the expanding solar wind,  (c) gradient and curature drift leaded by the heliospheric magnetic field
Though the cosmic ray transport equation have generally described and modeled those basic processes, the detailed roles of each components in the inner heliosphere and how the new measurement affected by the variable solar magnetic field are still not fully understood. \citep{Rankin2021ApJ}

Particulary the spatial gradient contains the valuable insight of the drift variation of the charged particle through the consecutive solar cycle. As illustrated by \citet{Jokipii1977ApJ, Jokipii1979ApJ, Potgieter2013LRSP}, the drift direction of energetic particle are different during opposite solar polarity, which reverses every $\sim$ 11 years and caused the $\sim$ 22-year cycle. Taking the recent solar minimum (\ac{SC} 24/25, 2020) as an example, the solar magnetic field are in the positive polarity age. The positively charged ions drift inward from the south and north pole region and outward out of the heliosphere along the equatorial plane through the the current sheet. While the situation is reversed in the opposite polarity, the ions drift inward from the equator and leave from the poles. Of course the drift behaviour of electrons are opposite to the ions.

Such a drift effect is reflected in the spatial gradient. The previous observtion by Voyager, Pioneer have found that the latitudinal gradient change sign in two consecutive solar cycles which belong to different polarity.
The comparison between most recent observtion from \ac{PSP} and history observations indicate the different magnetitude of radial gradient between different polarity solar cycle. Despite of this, the precious radial gradient of the current solar cycle especially during the ininial phase of the new solar cycle are not measured and determined.
The radial gradient could be express as \cite{Rankin2021ApJ} :
\begin{equation}
    g_r = \frac{1}{f}\frac{\partial{f}}{\partial{r}} = \frac{\partial{\mathrm{ln} f}}{\partial{r}}
\end{equation}
Where $g_r$ represents the radial gradient component under the assumption that the latitude gradient are neglectable. $f$ is the differential flux and $r$ is the radial distance. The radial gradient could be easily derived by fitting it to a linear equation according to the least minimum square method.


Benefiting from its special orbit with the cloest perihlion at 0.28 au, \ac{SolO} which is launched at the recent solar minimum 24/25 on 2020 provide valuabel insight of the transport effect of the cosmic rays in the inner heliosphere by measuring the radial gradient of those particles.
Below, we present the orbit information of \ac{SolO} from Feb 2020 to May 2023 in Fig.~\ref{fig:SOLO_orbit_info}, which includes the radial distance to the sun, the carrington longtitude and the carrrigton latitude of the \ac{SolO} in the top three panels. As shown in the top panel, the \ac{SolO} has finished five orbits and pass the sixth perihlion moving away from the sun. The closest distance is achived in the fifth cycle on the Sep of 2022. 
The carrington longititude \ac{SolO} indicates the movement of \ac{SolO} related to a fixed longitude line on the sun. Initially the carrington system and its origin point are defined from the Earth's point of view with the mean synodic period of approximately 27.2753 days. While in the \ac{SolO} coordinate becuase the radius of the orbit is not constant, the periods is varying between 26.6 and 35.8 days, slight differing from the period of the Earth.
The latitude is varifing below $\sim$ $\pm$8 degrees.

Besides, we also give the radial distance and the longitudinal seperation between \ac{SolO} and Earth in order to show the relative position of \ac{SolO} to the Earth.

To better visualize and understand the movement of \ac{SolO} in the inner heliosphere and its related position to the sun and the Earth, we draw the orbit track of \ac{SolO} in two different coordinate systems in Fig.~\ref{fig:SOLO_orbit_track}. The left panel show the orbit in helioscentric ecliptic coordinate system, which use the mean equinox as the direction of x axis. \ac{SolO} has an ellipse shape orbit in such a coordinate. On the other hand, in the right panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:SOLO_orbit_track}, the orbit is giving in helioscgraphic coordinate system in which the relative positions of the Sun, the central red point and the Earth, the blue point at 1 au are fixed. The orbits are twisted and changing its shape.

The color bars in both panels indicate the time sequence from Feb 2020 to May 2023. Moreover, the carrington rotation numbers are marked at the start of the each carrington cycle and labeled next to the orbit track. The moving direction of spacecraft can been read from change the number and colors.
%Obviously, when the spacecraft is located away the sun, the \ac{SolO} is moving in a limited region, with hardly changed longtitude in one carrington rotation. Conversely, the longitudinal changes are large when \ac{SolO} rapidly pass by the sun. Between them the radial distance change quickly. 


%In this report, we organized the content as following: We first introduce the data and instrument we used in this work, which including the SOLO/HET, SOHO/EPHIN, STEREO/LET and possiblely LND. In chapter 3 we give the overview of the observation of the helium-4 between 2020 and 2022 when in the second half, SEPs frequently happens and the overall cross-calibration between different instrument

%In section4, we explain the several kind of effect that could disturbe the constanct background and show how the result are affected by different method.  In the end, we conclude.

\section{Instrument}


The particle data reported in this study are mainly from the \acl{HET} onboard \ac{SolO} which measures ions in the energy range from tens of MeV/nuc to hundred MeV/nuc. Particularly, we focus on the heliums of \ac{ACR} energy from 10 MeV/nuc to 50 MeV/nuc. The detials of \ac{HET} can be found in the previous section and \citet{RodriguezPacheco-2019-EPD}.
Similar with \ac{SIS} observation by \citet{Mason-2021-SolOQuietTime}, the analysis of \ac{HET} measured helium is also contrained by their counting statistic due to the limited \ac{HET} geometry factor. In order to increase the count number and reduce the uncertainty, two measures are taken. First, we combined the data from four different directions. \ac{HET} is charaterized with its four apartures pointing to sun, antisun, south and north. By assuming the \acp{ACR} are isotropically distributed, summations of those data could effectively reduce the uncertainty to half. Furthermore, we extend the fine energy bins of \ac{HET} nominal data product and reconstruct the energy channel of particle stopping in C to the following energy range, 10 - 20 MeV/nuc, 20 - 30 Mev/nuc, 30 - 40 Mev/nuc, 40 - 50 Mev/nuc. The exact values of the left and right boundary of bins are determined by the values of nominal data products.

In addition to the nominal data products which are designed to provide precious intensity measurement with high energy resolution, we utilize one type of housekeeping data named any(a1, b1) to determine the \ac{SEP} period using the background and 3-sigma method. Here \textit{a1} and \textit{b1} represent the front two sensor head of \ac{HET} in sun direction. This level-2 trigger counts all  particles with energy above the threshold of detector A or detector B, which is set to 50 keV in the nominal mode \citep{Elftmann-2020-PhD}. This trigger can detect both energetic electron, protons and heavy ions without any elements resolution, making it an ideal indicator of the solar activity and \ac{SEP} with imporved counting statistics. Then we could determine a list of \ac{SEP} by applying the 3-sigma method.

Apart from the measurement from \ac{SolO}, we also utilized the observations from \ac{SOHO}/\ac{EPHIN}, \ac{ACESIS} and \ac{CRIS} onboard \ac{ACE} and \ac{LND} as a comparsion and reference line, in particular when encountering long term variations of the cosmic rays.

\section{Observation and data analysis}

\subsection{Overview observation between 2020 and 2022 and the cross calibration between four instruments}

Before we start deriving the radial gradient, we first have a quick overlook of the observation of heavier ions, including helium, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen from \ac{HET}, as Fig.~\ref{fig:overview} shown. After removed the possible \ac{SEP} contaminations, the averaged spectra between 2020 and 2022 are displayed.

We first go through all the data point in this figure.
The \ac{HET} measurements are marked as diamonds of different colors with red for helium-4, blue for oxygen, orange for carbon and green for nitrogen.
All the helium nominal scientific data products from \ac{HET} are presented which include particle stopping in detector B ($<$ 10 Mev/nuc), in detector C (10 - 100 MeV/nuc) and penetrating particles ($>$ 100 MeV/nuc), despite that the penetrating helium will not be used in the later analysis of \ac{ACR} gradient.
The penetrating helium composes of two populations depending on their primary energy, that are the just penetrating helium marked as empty red diamonds and the full penetrating particle with energy above 200 MeV/nuc. 

It is worth noting the potential issue of these penetrating data products. The intensity measured by two channels around 100 MeV/nuc are higher than the nearby channels and current we have no idea of the reason, probably due to the dead layer or because that the channels have not been properly calibrated.
Besides, the geometry factors of fully penetrating particles channels, i.e. the last three channels, are divided by a factor of two, to account for those \acp{GCR} equally incident from opposite directions. The current version of geometry factors are obtained based on the 2$\pi$ simulation by assuming the \ac{SEP} are highly anisotropic and arrive the detector from only one direction. 

The \ac{ACE} measurements are plotted as circles including filled circles representing \ac{ACESIS} and empty one for \ac{CRIS}. Unfortunately, \ac{ACESIS} only measured helium with energy below 15 MeV/nuc.
The helium data from \ac{SOHO}/\ac{EPHIN} are shown as the purple squares and the \ac{LND} measured helium-4 are shown as the brown triangles. Their measurement cover the \ac{ACR} energy range between 10 - 50 MeV/nuc and will be used in the later analysis.

The cross-comparison of the averaged spectra of all particle species in Fig.~\ref{fig:overview} reveals a general agreement between different instruments despite their distinct positions. This agreement indicates the reliable measurement of the \ac{SolO} and also \ac{LND}, which we for the first time report the helium-4 spectrum. Futhermore, the flat helium spectra between 10 MeV - 50 MeV/nuc and the higher intensity of oxygen and nitrogen at 10 MeV/nuc clearly demonstrate the presence of the \ac{ACR} components in the inner heliosphere. 
Later in Fig.~\ref{fig:helium_spec_1au}, we specifically focus on the helium-4 spectra based on the measurement when \ac{SolO} was positioned between 0.95 and 1 au. Still the \ac{EPHIN} and \ac{HET} helium of energy above 10 MeV/nuc are consistent, though the discrepancy appear for the energy channel below 10 Mev, especially for the \ac{ACESIS} and

Based on the orbit information, we could easily determind the period, when \ac{SolO} located near 1 au. such a list of periods in the last two years is given in Tab.~\ref{tab:1AU_period}.

To further compare and cross calibrate the measurement between different instrument, we extracted the data when the SOLO is located between 0.95 and 1 au. These period are marked out by the shadow region in the \ref{fig:overview}. The corresponding spectra are given in Fig.\ref{fig:spec}.

Considering the energy coverage of different L1 instruments we utitlized before and for the convinence of the comparison with SOLO, in the following chapter, we only consider the SOHO/EPHIN which could cover the energy between 10 - 50 MeV/nuc as the base line of SOLO.

\subsection{The time variation of the radial gradient}


\section{Results and summary}

We reported the ACR helium (10 - 50MeV/nuc) measured by SolO/HET from 2020 - 2022.9. The first half period is still the solar minimum with almost no solar activities and the second half has increasing number of solar eruptions.
The comparison between the helium spectra of SOLO/HET, SOHO/EPHIN and ACE/SIS indicates a good agreement. SolO and ACE are also consistent with each other for Carbon, Oxygen and Nitrogen.
We removed the long-term solar modulation, SEPs, and short-term variation due to CIR from the temporal profile and derived the radial gradient of helium over energy ~10 - 50 MeV/nuc.
The radial gradients of 10 - 20 MeV/nuc are consistent in two methods which are also compariable to the PSP results.
Solar activities affect the radial gradient. It is difficult to derive the weak radial gradient when the intensity changed dramatically.
Currently, the results have larger uncertainties and more discussions are needed to improve the results.
