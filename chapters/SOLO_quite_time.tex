With the launch of \ac{SOLO} and \ac{PSP}, we extend our measurment ability of the energetic particles to the inner heliosphere. For both SEP and GCR, ACR

The EPD are the key instrument suite for the measurement
SIS cover lower energy 
EPT cover the middel energy 
HET cover the high energy 
Together we have a complete measurement of the energetic particle energy distribution from keVs to few hunderd MeV/nuc

For instance several Larger SEP are observed, 
The study of the radial depend of the solar energetic particle events
The CIR modulation of cosmic Ray

Then one question is worth to investigate is what is the quite time spectra of different element looks like during solar minimum ( 2020.2-2021.1)

In the following section, we reported the quite time particle spectra measurement by  SIS and HET, including proton, Helium-4, Helium-3 , and heavy ions including C            arbon, Oxygen, Nitrogen and Iron.

\textit{The overview of the paper}
Below is a list of the key observations from the \citep{Mason-2021-SolOQuietTime}

We give the quite time lower energy spectra observed by the Solar orbiter HET and SIS. 
In Fig.2 the spectra of different particles species, including protons, helium-4, carbon, oxygen and iron, are shown.
Specially the He3 spectra measurement
