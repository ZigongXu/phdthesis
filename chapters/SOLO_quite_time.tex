(This this the start page of the SOLO GCR}

With the launch of SOLO and PSP, we extend out measurment ability to the inner heliosphere. 
SIS cover energy HET cover energy.
Together we have a 

Similar to the GCR spectra we studied using the LND

SOLO launched in 2020.2.10, provide the measurement of lower energy GCRs in the inner heliosphere from 2020.4 to 2021.1

The EPD includes SIS, HET, EPT

Think what you would like to say to introduce this paper:

SOLO launched and measured GCR


We give the quite time lower energy spectra observed by the Solar orbiter HET and SIS. 
In Fig.2 the spectra of different particles species, including protons, helium-4, carbon, oxygen and iron, are shown.
Specially the He3 spectra measurement 

Below is the lower energy particle spectra measured by SIS, EPT and HET onboard SOLO
