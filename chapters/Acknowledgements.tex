At this point, I would like to thank everyone who supported me during the course of my PhD studies and my work on MSL/RAD, Chang'E 4 LND as well as Solar Orbiter EPD.

First of all, I am grateful to my supervisor Prof. Robert Wimmer-Schweingruber for the opportunity to work on these exciting projects, and his helpful advice. He also made it possible that these results could be published in scientific journals and presented at many international conferences. Sincere thanks also to Prof. Jingnan Guo, who supported my work since my bachelor's thesis, and who I wish all the best for her new position in China.

Furthermore, thanks to all my colleagues in the three mission teams for their continued support and helpful discussions, including Zigong Xu, Alexander Kollhoff, and my officemate Christoph Terasa for the productive and enjoyable collaboration, e.g. on low- and high-level software for the Solar Orbiter mission, which will hopefully facilitate the EPD data analysis in the Kiel team for years to come, and to the rest of the Extraterrestrial Physics group at Kiel University. I also thank the group of Manuela Temmer and Astrid Veronig at the University of Graz and Mateja Dumbović at Hvar Observatory with whom I worked in close collaboration for many of the Forbush decrease studies, and who I enjoyed meeting regularly at the conferences in Vienna, Hvar and San Francisco.

I additionally want to thank the bachelor and master students who supported my work during their Hiwi positions, Charlotte Büschel and Niklas Lundt, and three secondary school students, Joana Wanger, Lukas Abegg and Markus Arndt, who contributed to the data sets used in my studies during their internships in the ET group.

I would like to thank Anne Fischer as well as Hanna Giese and Knud Schröter for their very thorough proofreading of this thesis and valuable suggestions, and my parents Kristina and Michael and my brother Julius for their moral support. 

Last but not least, the data analysis presented in this thesis, the typesetting of the thesis itself and the generation of most of the figures were made possible by a number of open source software projects, including, but not limited to, the ones acknowledged below:
